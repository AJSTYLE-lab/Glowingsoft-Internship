And whoever migrates for worldly gain or to marry a woman, then his migration will be for the sake of whatever he migrated for.\\\"\\n\\nRelated by Bukhari & Muslim\",commentary:\"This hadith is central to Islamic thought, culture, and understanding and shows the balance between the internal and external states of oneself. This hadith is great in its benefit and importance, and it has been said that Islam revolves around it. Scholars have commented that this hadith comprises one-third of knowledge because the actions of man involve his heart, his tongue and his limbs, and hence the intention in the heart is one-third of action. It is also deemed to be one-third of knowledge due to scholars commenting that this hadith along with two others comprises the religion of Islam. The other two hadith being “The Halal is clear and the Haram is clear and between them are doubtful matters”(1), and “Whoever innovates in this religion that which is not from it will have all his actions rejected (by Allah).”(2)\\n\\n# Actions are based on intention\\n\\nThe connection between action and intention highlights the connection between the physical and the spiritual components of any human. This hadith emphasizes on the importance of having an intention for every physical act that we do, and the importance of having a purpose for every action. It also brings to the forefront our conscious intention and the need to make the connection between our physical actions and their spiritual consequences.\\n\\nIntentions lead to results. When a change in intention occurs, a change in the external conditions will follow. Intention is also enough for Allah (swt) to make a change in our reality, so we should not belittle the necessary change in intention that has to occur in order for our external condition to change.\\n\\nSpecifically in regards to Islamic work and worship, the quality of intention is very important. Involvement in Islamic work should not be primarily intended for marriage or fame, but to worship Allah, help our community and spread love amongst our community.\\n\\n# Being a visionary\\n\\nThe believers should be visionaries because they should always be checking their intentions and understanding the purpose of their actions. They should be persistently asking themselves about their intentions for their short term and their long goals. Overall, the believer should constantly ask himself; “Why am I doing what I am doing?”\\n\\nUsing the words “shall have\\\" in this hadith means that the person will be rewarded for only that which he intended. So, as mentioned in the hadith, if a person performed the Hijrah, but did it with a different intention then he would not be rewarded for that action of Hijrah.\\n\\n# Showing Off\\n\\nRiya?, the showing off of deeds publicly, is a major sin which ruins sincerity and can invalidate actions. In the wording of the hadith, the use of the word “by” in “actions are but by intention” refers to the fact that the acceptance and correctness of any action depends on the intention behind it. For example, giving money in charity will not be accepted as a good deed if it was for the sake of showing off to others.\\n\\nThe Prophet (sas) informed us that if you perform an act for the sake of someone else rather than for Allah’s sake, then Allah will reject that deed entirely and will leave the reward of it for the partner that the person has made. This highlights the implications of showing off as well as the graveness of associating another person in your actions which should have been for the sake of Allah (swt). As mentioned in the hadith, 'Thus he whose migration was for Allah and His messenger, his migration was for Allah and His messenger, and he whose migration was to achieve some worldly benefit or to take some woman in marriage, his migration was for that for which he migrated.”\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nEverything we do has to be intended for the sake of Allah (swt). A good action with the wrong intention will not get us any reward in the Hereafter.\\n\\n \\\\[1] Hadith 5: Rejection of Evil Deeds and Innovations\\n\\n \\\\[2] Hadith 6: The Halal is Clear and the Haram is Clear\",video:\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CG7splCXvUE\",slug:\"1-actions-are-by-intentions\"},{title:\"Restricting Oneself to the Permissible\",hadith_count:\"10\",date:\"2019-10-07T19:49:05.551Z\",hadith_source:'عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ قَالَ:\\n\\n>  قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه و سلم \"إنَّ اللَّهَ طَيِّبٌ لَا يَقْبَلُ إلَّا طَيِّبًا، وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ أَمَرَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ بِمَا أَمَرَ بِهِ الْمُرْسَلِينَ فَقَالَ تَعَالَى: \"يَا أَيُّهَا الرُّسُلُ كُلُوا مِنْ الطَّيِّبَاتِ وَاعْمَلُوا صَالِحًا\"، وَقَالَ تَعَالَى: \"يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُلُوا مِنْ طَيِّبَاتِ مَا رَزَقْنَاكُمْ\" ثُمَّ ذَكَرَ الرَّجُلَ يُطِيلُ السَّفَرَ أَشْعَثَ أَغْبَرَ يَمُدُّ يَدَيْهِ إلَى السَّمَاءِ: يَا رَبِّ! يَا رَبِّ! وَمَطْعَمُهُ حَرَامٌ، وَمَشْرَبُهُ حَرَامٌ، وَمَلْبَسُهُ حَرَامٌ، وَغُذِّيَ بِالْحَرَامِ، فَأَنَّى يُسْتَجَابُ لَهُ؟\".',hadith_english:'On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:\\n\\n> “Allah the Almighty is good and accepts only that which is good.

O Lord!\" while his food is haram, his drink is haram, his clothing is haram, and he has been nourished with haram, so how can \\\\[his supplication] be answered?\"\\n\\n\\\\[Muslim]',commentary:\"_Written commentary compiled by volunteers utilizing Sh. Jamaal Diwan's audio commentary above and English translation of Ibn Daqiq Al-Id's commentary on The Forty Hadith of Imam al-Nawawi._\\n\\nThis hadith introduces the importance of al-tayyeb, that which is good or pure.  The concept of purity and goodness applies to numerous aspects in our lives. As Muslims, we must be careful to enjoy only food and clothing that are halal, use pure speech, and hold pure intentions.\\n\\nIn popular cultures today, there are so many impure things around us.  Indeed, such impurities have become so common and widespread that we may actually think they are beneficial. Nevertheless, if something is impure, then it cannot be good for us regardless of how many people like it or practice it. Our standards should not be set according to what most people say or do. Rather, they should be defined according to the revelation of Allah (swt).\\n\\n# The Concept of Al-Tayyeb\\n\\nAnother thing that we derive from this hadith is the importance of eating food that is tayyeb. This word does not simply mean that the food is halal or that it comes from a pure source, but it also means that the food is good for you. This hadith can be applied to eating out at a fast food restaurant. Even if the food is “halal” or “zabiha,” it may not necessarily be tayyeb. The reason it may not be tayyeb is that many of these foods are unhealthy, full of added chemicals and preservatives that may be harmful to our health.\\n\\n# Allah’s Acceptance\\n\\nThe concept of acceptance is also discussed in this hadith. Allah only accepts from those who are good and pure. What is this acceptance referring to? What if a person’s food and clothing are impure, will his or her actions be accepted? The answer to that question is a bit tricky. This person still has to do the action (i.e. praying, making duaa, etc.) in order to fulfill his or her responsibility towards that action, but Allah will not reward the person for doing such tasks. Thus, even though the person will not be rewarded for such action, he or she still needs to do it to avoid punishment.\\n\\n# Five conditions\\n\\nThe scholars mention five conditions that must be fulfilled in order for actions to be accepted:\\n\\n1. The belief that Allah (swt) is knowing of all things\\n2. To know the truth and have a sense of what is right\\n3. To have a pure intention in what you are doing\\n4. To do the action in accordance with the sunnah\\n5. To eat that which is halal\\n\\n# Acceptance of Duaa\\n\\nThere are several conditions that help our duaa be accepted by Allah (swt):\\n\\n1. To be traveling. The prophet (sas) said there are three duaas that are answered without doubt: the prayer of the oppressed, the prayer of a traveler, and the prayer of the parent for their child.\\n2. To be wearing clothes that are simple and humble. One should not be wearing arrogant or showy attire.\\n3. To raise one’s hands towards the sky while making duaa. The prophet (sas) says that Allah is shy and if someone raises his or her hands to Him with a prayer, He will be shy to not respond to that prayer.\\n4. To be consistent and persistent in the duaa. Do not expect a duaa to be answered immediately and be persistent in your asking of Allah. The prophet (sas) says that a person’s duaa will be accepted as long as they do not rush. Thus, duaa should be done with patience, consistency, and the knowledge that Allah (swt) will accept.\\n\\n# Duaa that is not accepted\\n\\nSimilarly, there are some circumstances that prevent our duaa from being answered:\\n\\n1. Income that is not halal. In order to obtain halal income, one must be doing a type of work that is halal.\\n2. The person must be fulfilling responsibilities on the job.

Jamaal Diwan's audio commentary above and English translation of Ibn Daqiq Al-Id's commentary on The Forty Hadith of Imam al-Nawawi._\\n\\nThis hadith is part of a longer hadith, and tells us that heart of a believer can be an indicator for him or her. However, this is only so when the heart is clean. The believer who is truly seeking the pleasure of Allah (swt) and is engaging in a process of purification for Allah (swt)’s pleasure can use their heart to help separate doubtful matters from what is certain.\\n\\n# Heightened Awareness of Allah (swt)\\n\\nWhen your heart is sensitive and connected to Allah, it may happen that you come across situations that don’t feel right. This hadith tells us that in these cases, the individual should leave what is unclear and causes discomfort for that which does not. Ar-Rayb, the word used in the hadith to refer to doubt, can refer to discomfort or instability. It is the opposite of tranquility; it upsets the person at some level. Many of the early scholars, from the angle of wara’a or heightened awareness of God, would be very careful about things that caused discomfort and doubt. For example, one of the scholars, Yazid ibn Zariya, did not take 500,000 dinars of inheritance from his father because his father used to work for rulers whom were corrupt.\\n\\n# Differences in Opinion\\n\\nOne issue that arises is that we may start to think it is better across the board to take the more difficult opinion when there is a difference of opinion. This is not necessarily the case. Ibn Rajab (ra) said about this “It’s possible that someone would derive from this that it is better to stay away from the difference of opinion between the scholars, because it is farther from the grey area, but the true and strong amongst the scholars are of the opinion that this is not in all cases.”\\n\\nFor example, there is a difference among the scholars regarding someone who knows that he made wudu but is not sure if he broke his wudu. Some of the scholars say it would be better if that person re-made their wudu, since there is doubt. But Ibn Rajab (ra) comments on this and says that this actually is not true, because it’s established that the Prophet (sas) said that the person should not make their wudu until they hear a sound or find a smell. The point is that there could be two differing opinions and one of them may be harder, but both could have a very strong foundation in the example of the Prophet (sas). If that is the case then it is not necessary to take the harder one.\\n\\n# Check Your Priorities\\n\\nSometimes a person may be committing major sins and suddenly have God-consciousness (wara’a) in small matters. Such a person is misplacing their attention and priorities. An example of this is a group of people who came to Makkah to ask ibn Umar (ra) if it was permissible to kill a mosquito in the state of ihram. Ibn Umar (ra)’s response was that they came from Iraq, where the grandsons of the Prophet (sas) had been killed, and yet they asked about the blood of a mosquito. He asked them to recheck their priorities. In another case, Bashir ibn al-Harith (ra) was asked if one should divorce his wife if his mom commanded him to do so. Bashir ibn al-Harith (ra) responded that if you are following the command of your mother in every other issue, then follow her in this issue as well. But if you don’t respect your mother and give her full regards in every other issue, or if you don’t treat your mother well, then don’t divorce your wife. This means that it’s not a sign of piety to pay attention to small things while letting the big matters slide.\\n\\nImam Ahmed also used to be very strict in these issues. For example, one time he asked someone to buy him some fat, and when it was brought it came on a piece of paper. He didn’t pay for the paper, only for the fat, so he commanded the person to return the piece of paper out of the heightened awareness of Allah (swt). It’s also said that he would never borrow ink from his companions and would always use his own ink.\\n\\n# How to Determine What is Doubtful\\n\\nIn some other narrations of the hadith, the addition to the end is “Verily good is what settles in one’s heart and evil is that which is doubtful.” This will be discussed in some of the ahadith coming up later in the 40 Hadith. The last thing to mention is that one of the ways to know what is doubtful is to look at things as opposites. If you’re trying to figure out if something is doubtful or permissible, you can look at its opposite. When you see the opposite sometimes it’s easier and clearer to understand the nature of that thing.\",video:\"https://youtube.com/embed/CtYBgGDeHxk\",slug:\"11-being-cautious-of-the-doubtful\"},{title:\"Leaving that Which Does Not Concern You\",hadith_count:\"12\",date:\"2019-10-07T19:54:52.971Z\",hadith_source:'عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ قَالَ: قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه و سلم\\n\\n>  \"مِنْ حُسْنِ إسْلَامِ الْمَرْءِ تَرْكُهُ مَا لَا يَعْنِيهِ\".\\r\\n\\nحَدِيثٌ حَسَنٌ، رَوَاهُ التِّرْمِذِيُّ \\\\[رقم: 2318] ، ابن ماجه \\\\[رقم:3976].',hadith_english:'On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:\\n\\n> \"Part of the perfection of one\\'s Islam is his leaving that which does not concern him.\"\\n\\n\\\\[Tirmidhi]',commentary:\"_Written commentary compiled by volunteers utilizing Sh. Jamaal Diwan's audio commentary above and English translation of Ibn Daqiq Al-Id's commentary on The Forty Hadith of Imam al-Nawawi._\\n\\nThis hadith explains an important but often overlooked aspect of completing and perfecting our practice of Islam. We should not concern ourselves with matters that are none of our business, but should stay focused on the priorities that do concern us. When our practice of Islam becomes more complete and more perfected, the good deeds we perform are multiplied to higher and higher exponents. By instilling this quality of focusing on what is of concern to you and disregarding what is not, deeds may become more weighty and valuable in the sight of Allah swt.\\n\\nOne of the great scholars of the Maliki school of fiqh, Imam Abu Zaid al-Maliki, said that all attributes of goodness stem from four hadiths\\\\[a]:\\n\\n1. The hadith in which the Prophet (sas) says to speak well or remain silent.\\n2. The present hadith.\\n3. The hadith in which the Prophet (sas) said to a man asking for advice- “Do not get angry. Do not get angry. Do not get angry.”\\n4. “You will not attain true belief until you love for your brother what you love for yourself.”\\n\\nThis hadith outlines a valuable approach to life, especially in our age of information overload and constant connection. In order to recognize the situations in which this characteristic can be applied, you must practice a degree of sensitivity and humility. Shaikh Abdul Fattah Abu Ghuddah mentions that even when someone must cancel an appointment or meeting with you, it is inappropriate to ask why since not every person can or wishes to explain the reason. Al-Hasan Al-Basri once said that one of the signs that Allah has turned away from a servant is that the servant finds himself continuously preoccupied and engaged in matters which are none of his concern.\\n\\n# How to Attain this Quality\\n\\nThere are three recommendations that can help someone stay focused on what is of concern to him or her, and not being distracted by superfluous issues.\\n\\n1. Exercise a degree of shyness and modesty, as rare and endangered as these qualities are today. Haya’, the qualities of humility, shyness, and modesty before Allah, is a valuable possession that the Prophet (sas) praised very highly. Allah says in the Quran, “Do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsels? Indeed We do, and Our messengers are by them, to record.”\\n2. Control your speech. Once a man noticed the Prophet Luqman surrounded by his followers and asked him, “Weren’t you the slave of so and so? Didn’t you used to be a shepherd for so and so? How did you get to such a respectful position among people?” Prophet Luqman, peace be upon him, answered, “Truthful speech, and long silence upon what does not concern me.”\\n3. Think about how you spend time. Al-Hasan al-Basri once said, “You are nothing but a compilation of breaths.” Every time you exhale, a piece of your life, a part of you, is lost. How many of our interactions are worthwhile and how many are useless? Allah says, “Most of their discussions do not contain any good, except of the one who enjoins charity or goodness or peace-making among people.” (4:114)\\n\\n# Understanding Priorities\\n\\nThe fiqh of priorities is in itself a large field of study in Islam. It is important that every person grasps enough of this concept to be able to recognize the priorities in their time and concerns. Imam Al-Ghazali said, “Disregarding the prioritization of good deeds in itself is a bad deed.” It is not simply a matter of identifying what concerns us and what not, but also the degrees of relevance and priority. In face of the avalanche of information, talk, social interactions, and distractions around us, an understanding of priorities can help us make choices, stay focused on what concerns us, and behave with beautiful manners and a more complete Islam.\",video:\"https://youtube.com/embed/cxDZGSNbTLA\",slug:\"12-leaving-that-which-does-not-concern-you\"},{title:\"Love for Your Brother What You Love for Yourself\",hadith_count:\"13\",date:\"2019-10-07T19:57:28.718Z\",hadith_source:'عَنْ أَبِي حَمْزَةَ أَنَسِ بْنِ مَالِكٍ رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ خَادِمِ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه و سلم عَنْ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه و سلم قَالَ:\\n\\n> \"لَا يُؤْمِنُ أَحَدُكُمْ حَتَّى يُحِبَّ لِأَخِيهِ مَا يُحِبُّ لِنَفْسِهِ\".\\r\\n\\nرَوَاهُ الْبُخَارِيُّ \\\\[رقم:13]، وَمُسْلِمٌ \\\\[رقم:45].\\r \\\\[رَوَاهُ الْبُخَارِيُّ]\\r، \\\\[وَمُسْلِمٌ].',hadith_english:'On the authority of Abu Hamzah Anas bin Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) - the servant of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) - that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said :\\n\\n> \"None of you will believe until you love for your brother what you love for yourself.\"\\n\\nRelated by Bukhari & Muslim',commentary:\"Written commentary compiled by volunteers utilizing Sh. Jamaal Diwan's audio commentary above and English translation of Ibn Daqiq Al-Id's commentary on The Forty Hadith of Imam al-Nawawi.\\n\\n# Golden Rule\\n\\nThis hadith is strongly correlated with the Golden Rule which is “do as to others what you want to yourself” and that is to love for your brother what you love for yourself. In this society, we live where people are shy to give advice or get offended to accept advice. When in reality, we should be welcoming in accepting other’s advice and give advice in the best way. This is essential for the fabric of the community and for your personal self.\\n\\n# Accepting the Truth\\n\\nIs it possible to be better than someone else? There is an authentic narration mentioned in Al Hakim where a companion asks the Prophet (pbuh), “Oh Messenger of Allah, you have seen what is bestowed upon me from beauty, and because of that beauty that has been bestowed upon me, I don’t like anyone else to look better than me. Is that arrogance? Is that transgression?”\\n\\nThe Prophet (pbuh) responds saying, “No, that’s not transgression, that’s not arrogance. What is arrogance or transgression is to the reject the truth when faced with it and to look down on people.”\\n\\nBased on this response, one of the characteristics of a believer is to accept the truth when they are confronted with it. So, when talking about loving for a brother what you love for yourself, that’s shouldn’t be an issue.\\n\\n# Flaws in Others\\n\\nAnother part of loving your brother what you love for yourself is really pushing the person to seek to rectify the flaws of others. Sometimes when we see flaws for others, instead of hoping, striving, and working toward rectify their difficulties in flaws, we actually exploit them. We take advantage of them and make ourselves feel better. This is actually a disease in the heart that we need to see someone to do something bad in order for us to feel good. Rather, we should fix their problems and love for them to able to grow in their relationship with Allah.\\n\\n# Hassad (Envy) & Ghibta (Jealousy)\\n\\nHassad is where you see something good in someone, and not only do you want it, but you want them to lose it. Whereas ghibta is you see that good in someone else, and you want it, but you want it without them losing it. So, if we feel like we want someone else to lose the good that they have, then that’s actually a problem in our belief, in the way that we look at our brother or our sister. It’s a problem in our love for our brother or our sister, and it’s contradictory to the meaning of this hadith.\\n\\n# Beyond the Translation\\n\\nIn the translation, it says “true belief” because we shouldn’t say that someone that does not attain this station is no longer a believer. They are a believer; they just haven’t reached that high level of faith. Another part of the hadith says “akhi” but some commentators say it’s not just “his brother”, it’s very general. This means it’s not just to Muslims, but all of humanity. Therefore for the person to receive true faith they have to love their brother in humanity, Muslim or non-Muslim, what they love for themselves. This is a very high level of spirituality and selflessness the true believer should seek.\\n\\nAnother characteristic of this hadith is wanting the brother to have what you have and even better. This doesn’t let us feel this scarcity mindset, and part of that is that it is a manifestation of us realizing that Allah is endless in His bounty. Sometimes when you look at what others have, we have that disease that makes us think that if they have it, then we can’t. However, Allah (swt) is endless in His bounty and endless in His generosity, even infinite in these qualities. Allah swt can give and take as He pleases so it shouldn’t make a difference if someone else has something as well.\\n\\nHolding yourself accountable is also an essential characteristic. You hold yourself accountable and question yourself about your feelings towards your brother, sister, or humanity and why you feel that way. We should seek to attain this level, to have this love towards a cause. This cause is a principle that we love and we know that Allah can give and He is bountiful, and not by anything else. For example, Imam Shafi’i said that he would love for people to learn this knowledge and that none of it would be attributed to him; which shows how beautiful his character was.\\n\\nMay Allah (swt) to beautify our character and forgive us for our sins and our shortcomings, and to help us love for our brothers what we love for ourselves. A closing story of Malcolm X, he was encountered by this hadith. He thought it was profound but didn’t know it was a hadith, yet stuck with him for the rest of his life. This is how the examples of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) should be, because these are timeless, amazing, beautiful, and expansive wisdoms that should stick with us and affect us with the way we look at life and the way we deal with others.\",video:\"https://youtube.com/embed/yUl-L0Oz_Ak\",slug:\"13-love-for-your-brother-what-you-love-for-yourself\"},{title:\"Prohibition of Blood of a Muslim\",hadith_count:\"14\",date:\"2019-10-07T19:59:54.251Z\",hadith_source:'عَنْ ابْنِ مَسْعُودٍ رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ قَالَ: قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه و سلم\\n\\n> \"لَا يَحِلُّ دَمُ امْرِئٍ مُسْلِمٍ \\\\[ يشهد أن لا إله إلا الله، وأني رسول الله] إلَّا بِإِحْدَى ثَلَاثٍ: الثَّيِّبُ الزَّانِي، وَالنَّفْسُ بِالنَّفْسِ، وَالتَّارِكُ لِدِينِهِ الْمُفَارِقُ لِلْجَمَاعَةِ\".\\r\\n\\n\\\\[رَوَاهُ الْبُخَارِيُّ]\\r، \\\\[وَمُسْلِمٌ].',hadith_english:'On the authority of Abdullah Ibn Masud (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:\\n\\n> \"It is not permissible to spill the blood of a Muslim except in three \\\\[instances]: the married person who commits adultery, a life for a life, and the one who forsakes his religion and separates from the community.\"\\n\\n\\\\[Al-Bukhari & Muslim]',commentary:\"_Written commentary compiled by volunteers utilizing Sh. Jamaal Diwan's audio commentary above and English translation of Ibn Daqiq Al-Id's commentary on The Forty Hadith of Imam al-Nawawi._\\n\\n# Ruling Only For Government\\n\\nSomeone’s blood and life is a very big issue. It is not something that you can take into your own hands; it’s not something to be decided by mere opinion. It is something that must be established and known through textual sources. The text has to be there and it is what clarifies whether or not there is any opening or discussion to these issues. In addition, they are issues of capital punishment and governance. They are not issues of personal vendettas or grudges carried out by individuals. They have to be carried out by governmental bodies.\\n\\nThe Prophet (pbuh) had many roles in the society, and amongst those roles he ran a state, he was a judge, and he gave opinions to people according to the religion. If it was something he did as a ruler or a judge, then we have to leave it that way, and it should not be something that applies to everyone else’s personal behavior. The topic of this hadith is a topic of governance and so it does not really apply to Muslims in the West.\\n\\n# How It’s Established\\n\\nFor the one that commits adultery, committing sexual acts outside the contract of marriage, the conditions for establishing such an act in front the court, and thereby requiring punishment, are very strict. There must be four male witnesses that witnessed the actual act itself, and they all have to come to court at the same time. If someone comes and makes this claim without having these four witnesses, then they will actually be punished for slandering the people that were accused. It’s severe because if someone is making an accusation like this, they have to make sure they have all of their evidences, otherwise the accuser themselves get punished, and this is done publicly. The other possibility is if someone confesses. Although this seems implausible, some scholars researched the court rulings that were carried out in the Ottoman Empire. They were shocked that there were people who committed adultery and then went to the court and confessed it.\\n\\nAs for the life for a life, there must be two reliable witnesses and it must be established by the court.\\n\\nAs for deciding that someone has left Islam, it is not something that is carried out by every individual. We can’t say someone said or did such-and-such, and because of it they are no longer Muslim so we have to kill them or take away their property. This is nonsense. It needs to be established by some sort of body that is official.\\n\\nIf the ruling is being applied, it is by a governmental body. However, the decision of whether or not a person is considered to be outside the fold of Islam needs to be done by scholars. These scholars would need to sit down with the person, ask particular questions, see what’s going on with them, and address any issues that can possibly be addressed. Once that has all taken place and there is still no reconciliation, then at that point, that particular individual can be labeled as a “kafir”, as someone who has left the religion of Islam. Again, this is not something that can be done by regular people. To go around calling someone else a kafir is absolute nonsense. Such behavior should not be accepted and steps should be taken to convince the individual of a different approach so as to limit the harm that comes from such declarations.\\n\\n# The Actual Punishment\\n\\nThe majority of scholars throughout history have said that the punishment for someone who commits adultery is death, but there is a very minority opinion that says their punishment is to be lashed, and that the government then has the option of capital punishment on top of the lashing.\\n\\nThere has been disagreement historically about the punishment of a life for a life. What if a slave kills a free person, what if a non-Muslim kills a Muslim, or vice versa in either case? The opinion that I believe is stronger, which I rarely say, is what is more applicable to our modern society, is that everyone is the same. Anyone that takes someone else’s life away, regardless of their social, religious, political status is eligible to receive the capital punishment. This punishment and whether it is to be carried out is in the hands of the family of the victim, whether they agree to the capital punishment or choose to forgive the offender.\\n\\nThe third case is where the person leaves Islam and the community. This ruling requires an entire political and religious system based on Islam. Not only do they leave their religion, but they are calling against the religion and fighting against the community. Some scholars say regardless of whether they turn against the community or not, once they leave the religion, they should receive capital punishment. Other scholars in history and modern time say it’s not applicable to someone that only leaves Islam but if they leave Islam and commit treason then they are eligible for the death penalty.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, these are all possibilities and the government chooses what laws it implements. Just because it’s a possibility, doesn’t mean it will be chosen. So governance and political theory get very complicated.\\n\\nOverall, someone else’s life and blood are very important and cannot be touched without textual support and government-based action. On top of that there are also strict ways to establish guilt in these cases. When it comes to confessing, some scholars say it’s actually better not to confess and to keep one’s sins secret. Rather, they should make sincere repentance to Allah and move on.\\n\\nMay Allah (swt) give us an understanding and forgive us for our sins and shortcomings.\",video:\"https://youtube.com/embed/VdcrzRMG1q8\",slug:\"14-prohibition-of-blood-of-a-muslim\"},{title:\"Islamic Manners\",hadith_count:\"15\",date:\"2019-10-07T20:02:12.255Z\",hadith_source:'عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه و سلم قَالَ:\\n\\n> \"مَنْ كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاَللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ فَلْيَقُلْ خَيْرًا أَوْ لِيَصْمُتْ، وَمَنْ كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاَللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ فَلْيُكْرِمْ جَارَهُ، وَمَنْ كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاَللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ فَلْيُكْرِمْ ضَيْفَهُ\".\\r\\n\\n\\\\[رَوَاهُ الْبُخَارِيُّ]\\r، \\\\[وَمُسْلِمٌ].',hadith_english:'On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:\\n\\n> \"Let him who believes in Allah and the Last Day speak good, or keep silent; and let him who believes in Allah and the Last Day be generous to his neighbour; and let him who believes in Allah and the Last Day be generous to his guest.\"\\n\\nRelated by Bukhari & Muslim',commentary:'_Written commentary compiled by volunteers utilizing Sh. Jamaal Diwan\\'s audio commentary above and English translation of Ibn Daqiq Al-Id\\'s commentary on The Forty Hadith of Imam al-Nawawi._\\n\\nSome of the scholars have mentioned that all of the Good Manners can be derived from four Hadiths, and they mentioned amongst them this Hadith. The focus of this Hadith is actions; actions of controlling one’s speech, actions of being good to your neighbor and actions of being generous to your guests. All these actions lead to the improvement of Muslims’ behaviors and manners.\\n\\n# Actions Manifest the Belief\\n\\nThe Hadith starts off by the Prophet’s statement “Whoever believes in Allah and the Day of Judgment,” then He (sas) resumes his Hadith talking about the Muslims’ action, which indicates that actions are part of our belief. It is not enough that we are Muslims or it is not enough that we say that we believe in Allah (swt) and in the Prophet (peace be upon him) but also this belief should manifest one’s actions. That is why the scholars said, “Belief is what settles in the heart and manifest itself on one’s limbs.” It is part of Islam to act on what you believe in and act upon the teachings of the prophet (peace be upon him) and the teachings of the Quran.\\n\\nThe Prophet (sas) put emphases on the importance of each action by repeating the statement “Whoever believes in Allah and the Day of Judgment,” with every single action. It is a constant repetition and reminder that these actions should come out of one\\'s belief.\\n\\n# Speak Good, or Keep Silent\\n\\nTo control our speech is a very important aspect in manifesting our belief also it is very important for our own spiritual development. If person wishes to say something, then if that speech is good, and will surely be rewarded for, then let him say it. And if not, then let him keep silent - whether it is apparent that the speech is Haram (forbidden) or Makrooh (disliked) or even Mubah (permissible). It is said that the permissible speech is to be left and avoided, and rather it is preferred to keep silent in such situations, out of fear that it may turn into something which is Haram or Makrooh.\\n\\n# Be Generous to your Neighbors; Be Generous to your Guests\\n\\nThis is something that has been neglected a lot of times especially by the Muslims in the West. The Prophet’s statement \"let him be generous to his neighbor\" and \"let him be generous to his guest\" contains instruction on the rights of the neighbors and on doing good to them and encouragement upon protecting the limbs from doing harm to them, and also Allah (swt) has advised us in His Noble Book with Ihsan (good behavior, kindness, good treatment) towards the neighbors. And the Prophet (sas) has said: \"Jibreel (as) did not cease to advise me regarding the rights of the neighbor, until I began to think that they would also receive a part of the inheritance\".\\n\\nAnd hospitality is from Islam, and from the character of the Prophets and the Pious. And some of the scholars have made it obligatory, though the majority considers it to be from the noble, recommended traits of character.\\n\\n# Summary\\n\\n* One should only speak what is good and true\\n* One must not under any circumstances speak evil or use filthy language\\n* One should be kind and generous to one’s neighbor\\n* One should treat one’s guest well\\n* If one is a true Muslim then one would do the above, else one’s \\\\[true] belief in Allah and the Last Day is in question',video:\"https://youtube.com/embed/Cdu6H8wDorY\",slug:\"15-islamic-manners\"},{title:\"The Forbiddance of Anger\",hadith_count:\"16\",date:\"2019-10-07T20:04:25.037Z\",hadith_source:'عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ أَنَّ رَجُلًا قَالَ لِلنَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه و سلم أَوْصِنِي. قَالَ:\\n\\n> \"لَا تَغْضَبْ، فَرَدَّدَ مِرَارًا، قَالَ: لَا تَغْضَبْ\" .\\r\\n\\n\\\\[رَوَاهُ الْبُخَارِيُّ].',hadith_english:\"On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him):\\n\\n> “A man said to the Prophet, ‘Give me advice.’ The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, ‘Do not get angry.’ The man asked repeatedly and the Prophet answered each time, ‘Do not get angry.’”\\n\\nRelated by Bukhari & Muslim\",commentary:'_Written commentary compiled by volunteers utilizing Sh.

That is why the Prophet mentioned in another hadith: \"The powerful man is not the one who can wrestle, but the powerful man is the one who can control himself at the time of anger.\" Controlling anger can be an indicator of the strength of one’s personality.\\n\\n# Background on the Hadith\\n\\nThis man recognized not only that the Prophet (sas) was the messenger of Allah, but that he was the best person to seek advice from. This shows you that the people used to come to the Prophet (sas) whenever they needed advice, even in personal issues. This time the Prophet’s advice to this man was, “Don’t get angry.”\\n\\nSome scholars say that the Prophet knew that this man specifically had a problem in controlling anger, hence this advice. However, this view may lead to narrowing the benefit of the hadith to just one individual. Because almost everyone struggles with anger at some time or another in their lives, this comprehensive and far-reaching advice should be applied to everyone.\\n\\n# Anger in the Quran and Hadith\\n\\nAllah mentions as one of the qualities of the Muttaqeen, the God-conscious, that they control their anger:\\n\\n> _“Those who spend (in Allah’s cause) in prosperity and in adversity, who repress their anger, and who pardon men, verily, Allah loves the al-Muhsinun (the good-doers).” (3:134)_\\n\\n“Don’t become angry” doesn’t mean that it is impermissible to have any sort of anger, because that would be outside human ability. There is a rule in Usul al-fiqh which states that it is not permissible for someone to be held accountable for that which he can’t control. Anger is part of human nature. The real question is, what is the permissible level of anger? How can we handle that anger when we do become angry?\\n\\nWhen the Prophet (sas) insisted on not getting angry, he implied that controlling one’s anger is a comprehensive act. Anger opens the door to all bad qualities and staying away from it opens the door to all good qualities. One of the Prophet’s companions said, “Anger is the key to all evil.”\\n\\n# Anger Management Based on the Sunnah\\n\\nThere are different strategies for handling anger, depending on the person and situation. If a person gets angry, then he or she should exercise muhasabah (holding the self accountable) for the mistakes committed, what led to them, and how to overcome them in the future. Examining the self and holding ourselves accountable is important training and a source of discipline and self-improvement.  In various hadiths, the Prophet (sas) teaches us methods to help with anger:\\n\\n* Seeking refuge in Allah: The Prophet (sas) said, \"I know a word, the saying of which will cause him to relax, if he does say it. If he says: \\'I seek Refuge with Allah from Satan\\' then all his anger will go away.\"  When we seek refuge in Allah, we should say the words with understanding and reflection, not simply recite the words.\\n* Changing your posture: The Prophet of Allah said, \"When one of you becomes angry while standing, he should sit down. If the anger leaves him, well and good; otherwise he should lie down.\"\\n* Keeping quiet: The Prophet (sas) said, “If one of you becomes angry then he should stay silent.” This is an important practice because when we are angry our actions and speech may be disproportionate and unjust.\\n* Wudu can also be a shield against anger. The Prophet (sas) said, “Anger comes from the devil, the devil was created from fire, and fire is extinguished only with water. So when one of you becomes angry, he should make wudu.”\\n\\n# Praiseworthy Anger\\n\\nSometimes anger can be good.  The Prophet never got angry except when the commandments of Allah were violated. However, if we do feel anger for the sake of Allah, we should make sure that we are not actually getting angry for our own ego or interests. We should express the anger in the right way; just because the anger is for the right cause does not give anyone license to behave badly. There should also be some benefit in the anger. If expressing the anger leads to more harm than benefit, then it should be avoided based on the principle of weighing benefit and harm. For example, when giving advice: say it in a good way, use good words and the best manners, and be careful not to escalate into a quarrel.\\n\\n# Harmful Effects of Getting Angry\\n\\nThere are many harmful effects of getting angry. These effects can harm us physically, psychologically, socially or emotionally.  It is well known today that anger causes many health problems and can be a symptom or cause of mental illness, especially if not controlled. There are wisdoms behind shariah injunctions, and improving overall well being is one of the many benefits of controlling anger.',video:\"https://youtube.com/embed/cDKSToqJqWo\",slug:\"16-the-forbiddance-of-anger\"},{title:\"Prescription of Ihsan (Perfection)\",hadith_count:\"17\",date:\"2019-10-07T20:10:27.400Z\",hadith_source:'عَنْ أَبِي يَعْلَى شَدَّادِ بْنِ أَوْسٍ رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ عَنْ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه و سلم قَالَ:\\n\\n> \"إنَّ اللَّهَ كَتَبَ الْإِحْسَانَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ، فَإِذَا قَتَلْتُمْ فَأَحْسِنُوا الْقِتْلَةَ، وَإِذَا ذَبَحْتُمْ فَأَحْسِنُوا الذِّبْحَةَ، وَلْيُحِدَّ أَحَدُكُمْ شَفْرَتَهُ، وَلْيُرِحْ ذَبِيحَتَهُ\".\\r\\n\\n\\\\[رَوَاهُ مُسْلِمٌ].',hadith_english:'On the authority of Abu Ya\\'la Shaddad bin Aws (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:\\n\\n> \"Verily Allah has prescribed ihsan (perfection) in all things.

Let each one of you sharpen his blade and let him spare suffering to the animal he slaughters.\"\\n\\n\\\\[Muslim]',commentary:\"_Written commentary compiled by volunteers utilizing Sh. Jamaal Diwan's audio commentary above and English translation of Ibn Daqiq Al-Id's commentary on The Forty Hadith of Imam al-Nawawi._\\n\\nIslam commands Muslims to practice and apply Ihsan, striving for excellence, in all that they do. Ihsan is so important that it was actually made obligatory, or wajib. It has been mentioned in the Quran, where Allah the Almighty says,\\n\\n> _Verily, Allah enjoins justice, and ihsan and giving help to relatives, and He forbids immoral sins, evil and tyranny. He admonishes you, so that perhaps you may take heed. (16:90)_\\n\\nThe structure of this hadith is very similar to the first one of Imam Al-Nawawi’s collection. The Prophet (sas) spoke in the first Hadith about intentions, then he gave an example to clarify what he meant by intentions. Likewise in this hadith, the Prophet (sas) speaks about ihsan and then gives an example of what ihsan means and how to apply it.\\n\\n# Components of Ihsan\\n\\nWhen the Prophet (sas) used the terminology: “Allah has written ihsan upon everything,” the scholars of Usul al-fiqh\\\\[1] said that the word “written” implies obligation. Whenever the terminology “written” is used in the Quran or sunnah it implies a religious mandate. We are bound, then, to strive for excellence in everything we do.\\n\\nIhsan is a comprehensive concept. It includes doing things completely, nicely and in a tasteful manner. It comprises four components:\\n\\n1. Sincerity (Ikhlas)\\n2. Completeness\\n3. Tastefulness (doing things in a pleasant manner), and\\n4. Correctness (doing things the right way).\\n\\nA Muslim who practices ihsan throughout his life is a responsible person and a person of high quality. He does things in the best manner, in a pleasant and tasteful way, and is never satisfied with anything other than a top-notch quality job in all that he does. He or she is motivated to exercise this excellence because Allah prescribed ihsan for all deeds.\\n\\nIt is very important to apply ihsan to our deen and our relationship with Allah (swt). Sometimes we do the least possible thing to get by. Islam shouldn’t be understood this way, but rather as a way of life that is based on continuous striving for excellence. It is based on the understanding that God is watching and that He knows what we do. That God-consciousness should lead us to ihsan.\\n\\n# Applying Ihsan\\n\\nThe meaning of \\\"killing well\\\" is to exert oneself the utmost in performing the action well, without causing unnecessary pain or torment through it. “Slaughtering well\\\" implies that we show kindness to the animal being slaughtered, do not push it to the ground cruelly or harshly, nor drag it from one place to another. It also includes facing it towards the Qibla, pronouncing the name of Allah upon it, cleanly and quickly cutting the throat and the two jugular veins, and finally leaving it until it has turned cold. This hadith also includes recognizing and acknowledging Allah's favors upon us, and thanking Him and being grateful to Him. Allah (swt) has subjected some of His creation to us, and made their meat permissible when He could have made it forbidden, if He had wished.\\n\\n# Example of Abu Bakr\\n\\nAcquiring Ihsan requires a level of preparation. We can’t practice ihsan without proper planning and readiness.\\n\\nOne of the best examples is the example of Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, who applied excellence in everything he did. When the Prophet (sas) gave permission to the companions to migrate to Madinah, Abu Bakr declined to migrate with the companions, secretly hoping that he could accompany the Prophet (sas) on his journey. While he was waiting, he readied two camels, fed them, and made sure they were ready to leave at a moments notice. This is true Ihsan; it is not only doing the action itself in the best way, but preparing for the action in the best way.\\n\\n\\\\[1] Usul al-Fiqh are the principles underlying fiqh (religious jurisprudence); in other words, legal theory.\",video:\"https://youtube.com/embed/uFG9LcpQRJU\",slug:\"17-prescription-of-ihsan-perfection\"},{title:\"Follow Up a Bad Deed with a Good Deed\",hadith_count:\"18\",date:\"2019-10-08T04:57:06.508Z\",hadith_source:'عَنْ أَبِي ذَرٍّ جُنْدَبِ بْنِ جُنَادَةَ، وَأَبِي عَبْدِ الرَّحْمَنِ مُعَاذِ بْنِ جَبَلٍ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمَا، عَنْ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه و سلم قَالَ:\\n\\n> \"اتَّقِ اللَّهَ حَيْثُمَا كُنْت، وَأَتْبِعْ السَّيِّئَةَ الْحَسَنَةَ تَمْحُهَا، وَخَالِقْ النَّاسَ بِخُلُقٍ حَسَنٍ\" .\\r\\n\\nرَوَاهُ التِّرْمِذِيُّ \\\\[رقم:1987] وَقَالَ: حَدِيثٌ حَسَنٌ، وَفِي بَعْضِ النُّسَخِ: حَسَنٌ صَحِيحٌ.',hadith_english:\"On the authority of Abu Dharr Jundub ibn Junadah, and Abu 'Abd-ir-Rahman Mu'adh bin Jabal (may Allah be pleased with them) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n> \\\"Be conscious of Allah wherever you are. Follow the bad deed with a good one to erase it, and engage others with beautiful character.\\\"\\r\\n\\nRelated by Tirmidhi\",commentary:\"_Written commentary compiled by volunteers utilizing Sh. Jamaal Diwan's audio commentary above and English translation of Ibn Daqiq Al-Id's commentary on The Forty Hadith of Imam al-Nawawi._\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nIn this hadith, the Prophet (sas) teaches us that we must have God-consciousness in every possible scenario: “wherever you may be.” Whether you are alone, in public, in a position of leadership, weakness, or strength, you should be aware and fearful that Allah is watching. This consciousness, keen awareness, and fearfulness of God at every time and in every place is called taqwa.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n# Visualizing Taqwa\\r\\n\\nSome of the companions explained the concept of taqwa as the following: “If you were to walk through a thorny patch wearing long clothing, how would you walk through that patch?’’ Someone answered that they would gather their clothes together and step over the thorns to avoid tearing their clothing; such is taqwa. This level of consciousness of Allah, knowing that He is watching us and having this awareness of Him in every moment is something that we should seek to instill in all aspects of our life.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nThere is a story about a teacher who preferred a student over the rest. The students would ask why and he would answer, “You’ll understand.” He did an experiment where he gave all of his students food and told them to go somewhere where no one could see them and eat it. They all went to different places and ate the treat, except for the one student. He was asked why he did not eat, and he answered, “You told us to go eat somewhere where we cannot be seen, and there is no where I can go where Allah will not see me. So, I didn’t eat.” The Sheikh told the students, “This is why I prefer him over the rest of you.” This awareness of Allah’s presence is an example of taqwa.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nIt may not be easy to build and deepen taqwa within ourselves, so we should actively call upon Allah (swt) for help. Imam Ash-Shafi said, “Three things are very difficult: to be generous when you have little, to be fearful of Allah when you are alone, and to say the truth in front of someone whom you fear or hope for their good opinion.” The Prophet (sas) used to make duaa saying, “Oh Allah, I ask of You to bestow upon me taqwa.” He also used to say, “I ask you that I fear You at times when I am seen and the times when I am not seen (by people).” We can learn from this sunnah of the Prophet (sas) to make duaa that Allah inspires us and blesses us with taqwa.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n# A Follow-up to Bad Deeds\\r\\n\\nThis part of the hadith is proactive, an aspect that many Muslims don’t practice. Our understanding of sin should be mobilizing, not debilitating. Too often, we respond to a sin by putting ourselves in a figurative corner and abusing ourselves psychologically until we get over that sin. This is not what Allah wants from us. Yes, we should feel guilty and have a level of regret, but it should not stop us from moving forward in good deeds. People use their sins as an excuse to stay behind, but do not stop yourself from all the other good that you could be involved in.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nThe response to a sin should not be to wait, but rather to race to do something good so the sin can be erased. Our attitude should be proactive and positive. We should always have hope that Allah can, and will, have mercy on us as long as we keep struggling and pushing forward.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n# Good Manners\\r\\n\\nWhen you practice the hadith’s first two components of God-consciousness and following the bad deed with a good one, you will end up with the third component of good character. Good character is a true test of religiosity. Many times, people are outwardly religious, but their manners are terrible. They engage in religious matters with enthusiasm, but when it comes to business, they mistreat their employees. It is not just about what is legal; that is not what our standard of goodness is. The Prophet (sas) was sent and confirmed by Allah to have a very high level of morals and to be very strict in his ethics. We have to hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards and be morally rigorous, because it is part of what it means to bear witness to the world around us and carry the message of Islam. The Prophet (sas) was asked, “What will enter the greatest amount of people into Paradise?” His response was, “Taqwa of Allah and dealing with people in a nice and beautiful way.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nIn another hadith narrated by Bukhari, the Prophet (sas) said the one who has good manners may attain the same level of merit as those who fast and pray frequently. When you stand in the night and you fast during the long days, you’re struggling with yourself against yourself. But when you strive to have good manners, you are struggling with yourself while amongst others. It is a higher level of interaction, and it can actually be more difficult than praying in the night and fasting during the day.\",video:\"https://youtube.com/embed/8kNcXhUUCZc\",slug:\"18-follow-up-a-bad-deed-with-a-good-deed-1\"},{title:\"Be Mindful of Allah and Allah will Protect You\",hadith_count:\"19\",date:\"2019-10-08T02:50:02.885Z\",hadith_source:'عَنْ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ بْنِ عَبَّاسٍ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمَا قَالَ:\\n\\n> كُنْت خَلْفَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه و سلم يَوْمًا، فَقَالَ: يَا غُلَامِ! إنِّي أُعَلِّمُك كَلِمَاتٍ: احْفَظْ اللَّهَ يَحْفَظْك، احْفَظْ اللَّهَ تَجِدْهُ تُجَاهَك، إذَا سَأَلْت فَاسْأَلْ اللَّهَ، وَإِذَا اسْتَعَنْت فَاسْتَعِنْ بِاَللَّهِ، وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ الْأُمَّةَ لَوْ اجْتَمَعَتْ عَلَى أَنْ يَنْفَعُوك بِشَيْءٍ لَمْ يَنْفَعُوك إلَّا بِشَيْءٍ قَدْ كَتَبَهُ اللَّهُ لَك، وَإِنْ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَضُرُّوك بِشَيْءٍ لَمْ يَضُرُّوك إلَّا بِشَيْءٍ قَدْ كَتَبَهُ اللَّهُ عَلَيْك؛ رُفِعَتْ الْأَقْلَامُ، وَجَفَّتْ الصُّحُفُ .\\n\\n رَوَاهُ التِّرْمِذِيُّ \\\\[رقم:2516] وَقَالَ: حَدِيثٌ حَسَنٌ صَحِيحٌ.\\n\\nوَفِي رِوَايَةِ غَيْرِ التِّرْمِذِيِّ: \"احْفَظْ اللَّهَ تَجِدْهُ أمامك، تَعَرَّفْ إلَى اللَّهِ فِي الرَّخَاءِ يَعْرِفُك فِي الشِّدَّةِ، وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ مَا أَخْطَأَك لَمْ يَكُنْ لِيُصِيبَك، وَمَا أَصَابَك لَمْ يَكُنْ لِيُخْطِئَك، وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ النَّصْرَ مَعَ الصَّبْرِ، وَأَنْ الْفَرَجَ مَعَ الْكَرْبِ، وَأَنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْرًا.',hadith_english:\"Abu al-‘Abbas ‘Abdullah bin ‘Abbas(ra) reports:\\n\\n> “One day I was riding (a horse/camel) behind the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, when he said, ‘Young man, I will teach you some words. Be mindful of God, and He will take care of you. Be mindful of Him, and you shall find Him at your side. If you ask, ask of God. If you need help, seek it from God. Know that if the whole world were to gather together in order to help you, they would not be able to help you except if God had written so. And if the whole world were to gather together in order to harm you, they would not harm you except if God had written so. The pens have been lifted, and the pages are dry.’ ”\\n\\nRelated by Tirmidhi\",commentary:\"Ibn Abbas was, at most, 13 years old when he was gifted these words of advice by Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. Imagine the impression this made on a teenager, who would grow up to be an ocean of knowledge and for whom the Prophet said the prayer, “Allah, give him understanding of the religion, and teach him to discern its meanings.” As we equip children with every means of success, we should not forget to imprint in their memory and hearts these powerful rules to live by.\\r\\n\\nIn another narration, the Prophet says, “Be mindful of Allah, you shall find Him in front of you. Know Allah in times of prosperity so He will know you in times of hardship. Know that whatever passed you by could never have happened, and what happened could never have been avoided. Know that victory comes with patience, relief comes with affliction, and with hardship comes ease.”\\r\\n\\n# Take Care of Your Relationship with Allah\\r\\n\\n“Be mindful of Allah, He will be mindful of you...” This hadith reveals core truths about the nature of our relationship with Allah. If you take care of your relationship with Him, He will take care of you. Whatever you need or desire, in the end it can only come from Him. This is not to say that we can never ask people for help, but we should understand that ultimately Allah is the source of all help that comes our way. The companions used to ask Allah for help in everything, large or small, even in getting salt for their food.\\r\\n\\nWe sometimes get bogged down with the side issues in our religion: with definitions, fiqh issues, and the differences between us, while forgetting the essence of our relationship with the Creator. The Prophet captured this essence for Ibn Abbas and for all Muslims, and taught us that as long as we turn to Allah, we will be all right. In order to understand we must try it; it is one thing to read about it, and another to actually experience finding Allah at your side in moments of hardship.\\r\\n\\nThe Prophet told us a story of three men who were caught in a storm and sought shelter in a cave. No sooner had they entered the cave than a massive boulder fell and blocked the only exit. The three men called upon Allah to help them, testifying to deeds they had done solely for the sake of Allah, and as each one told the story of their deed, the boulder shifted and they were able to escape. One lesson of this story is that if we are mindful and obedient to Allah in times of ease and enablement, He will be at our side when we are desperate.\\r\\n\\n# Freedom Through Reliance on Allah\\r\\n\\nWhat transformation will take place when we internalize the guidance in this hadith: being mindful of Allah so that He takes care of us; seeking help only of Allah; and understanding that no good or harm, no matter how inevitable it seems, can befall us unless Allah wills? There is tremendous freedom from the hindrances of fear and loneliness when we rely only on Allah. Great acts of courage, patience and independence become possible, because the individual senses the company of Allah by his or her side. When Prophet Ibrahim was about to be burned alive after destroying the idols of his people, the angel Jibreel came to him and asked him, “Do you need help?” Ibrahim replied, “From you? No. As for Allah? Then yes!”\\r\\n\\nMoreover, the we know that whatever harm Allah has written for us is inevitable, because the “pens have been lifted and the pages have dried.” We can put our hearts and minds to rest, knowing that what is written will come to be no matter what, and Allah will be at our side.\\r\\n\\n# Difficulty Lies Ahead\\r\\n\\nIt is implied in the hadith that there will be challenges and trials for the believer. Perhaps it is in difficulty that the strength and power of the Prophet’s words shine brightest. Hardship is never meant to break us. Even in the darkest moments, there will be unexpected sources of coolness and ease, and always the hope of victory that comes with patience. Allah says in the Quran:\\n\\n> وَلَنَبْلُوَنَّكُم بِشَىْءٍ مِّنَ ٱلْخَوْفِ وَٱلْجُوعِ وَنَقْصٍ مِّنَ ٱلْأَمْوَٰلِ وَٱلْأَنفُسِ وَٱلثَّمَرَٰتِ ۗ وَبَشِّرِ ٱلصَّٰبِرِينَ (١٥٥) ٱلَّذِينَ إِذَآ أَصَٰبَتْهُم مُّصِيبَةٌ قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّا لِلَّهِ وَإِنَّآ إِلَيْهِ رَٰجِعُونَ (١٥٦) أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ عَلَيْهِمْ صَلَوَٰتٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَرَحْمَةٌ ۖ وَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُهْتَدُونَ (١٥٧)\\n\\nWe shall certainly test you with fear and hunger, and loss of property, lives, and crops. But give good news to those who are steadfast. Those who say, when afflicted with a calamity, ‘We belong to God and to Him we shall return.’ These will be given blessings and mercy from their Lord, and it is they who are rightly guided.\\r\\n\\n(Al-Baqarah 2:155-157)\",video:\"https://youtube.com/embed/Bq-O3rMGlkM\",slug:\"19-be-mindful-of-allah-and-allah-will-protect-you\"},{title:\"Islam, Iman, Ihsan\",hadith_count:\"2\",date:\"2019-10-07T19:08:14.609Z\",hadith_source:'عَنْ عُمَرَ رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ أَيْضًا قَالَ:\\n\\n>  \" بَيْنَمَا نَحْنُ جُلُوسٌ عِنْدَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه و سلم ذَاتَ يَوْمٍ، إذْ طَلَعَ عَلَيْنَا رَجُلٌ شَدِيدُ بَيَاضِ الثِّيَابِ، شَدِيدُ سَوَادِ الشَّعْرِ، لَا يُرَى عَلَيْهِ أَثَرُ السَّفَرِ، وَلَا يَعْرِفُهُ مِنَّا أَحَدٌ. حَتَّى جَلَسَ إلَى النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه و سلم . فَأَسْنَدَ رُكْبَتَيْهِ إلَى رُكْبَتَيْهِ، وَوَضَعَ كَفَّيْهِ عَلَى فَخِذَيْهِ،\\r\\n>\\n> وَقَالَ: يَا مُحَمَّدُ أَخْبِرْنِي عَنْ الْإِسْلَامِ.\\r\\n>\\n> فَقَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه و سلم الْإِسْلَامُ أَنْ تَشْهَدَ أَنْ لَا إلَهَ إلَّا اللَّهُ وَأَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ اللَّهِ، وَتُقِيمَ الصَّلَاةَ، وَتُؤْتِيَ الزَّكَاةَ، وَتَصُومَ رَمَضَانَ، وَتَحُجَّ الْبَيْتَ إنْ اسْتَطَعْت إلَيْهِ سَبِيلًا.\\r\\n>\\n> قَالَ: صَدَقْت . فَعَجِبْنَا لَهُ يَسْأَلُهُ وَيُصَدِّقُهُ!\\r\\n>\\n> قَالَ: فَأَخْبِرْنِي عَنْ الْإِيمَانِ.\\r\\n>\\n> قَالَ: أَنْ تُؤْمِنَ بِاَللَّهِ وَمَلَائِكَتِهِ وَكُتُبِهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ، وَتُؤْمِنَ بِالْقَدَرِ خَيْرِهِ وَشَرِّهِ.\\r\\n>\\n> قَالَ: صَدَقْت. قَالَ: فَأَخْبِرْنِي عَنْ الْإِحْسَانِ.\\r\\n>\\n> قَالَ: أَنْ تَعْبُدَ اللَّهَ كَأَنَّك تَرَاهُ، فَإِنْ لَمْ تَكُنْ تَرَاهُ فَإِنَّهُ يَرَاك.\\r\\n>\\n> قَالَ: فَأَخْبِرْنِي عَنْ السَّاعَةِ. قَالَ: مَا الْمَسْئُولُ عَنْهَا بِأَعْلَمَ مِنْ السَّائِلِ.\\r\\n>\\n> قَالَ: فَأَخْبِرْنِي عَنْ أَمَارَاتِهَا؟ قَالَ: أَنْ تَلِدَ الْأَمَةُ رَبَّتَهَا، وَأَنْ تَرَى الْحُفَاةَ الْعُرَاةَ الْعَالَةَ رِعَاءَ الشَّاءِ يَتَطَاوَلُونَ فِي الْبُنْيَانِ. ثُمَّ انْطَلَقَ، فَلَبِثْتُ مَلِيًّا،\\r\\n>\\n> ثُمَّ قَالَ: يَا عُمَرُ أَتَدْرِي مَنْ السَّائِلُ؟.\\r\\n>\\n> ‫‬قُلْتُ: اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَعْلَمُ.\\r\\n>\\n> قَالَ: فَإِنَّهُ جِبْرِيلُ أَتَاكُمْ يُعَلِّمُكُمْ دِينَكُمْ \".\\n\\n \\\\[رَوَاهُ مُسْلِمٌ]\\r\\n\\n.',hadith_english:'It was narrated on the authority of Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), who said:\\n\\n> While we were one day sitting with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), there appeared before us a man dressed in extremely white clothes and with very black hair.

Jamaal Diwan's audio commentary above and English translation of Ibn Daqiq Al-Id's commentary on The Forty Hadith of Imam al-Nawawi.\\n\\n# The Significance of this Hadith\\n\\nThis hadith includes within it all outwardly actions and inwardly beliefs. The sciences of the Sharia’ return back to this hadith due to it encompassing knowledge of the Sunnah. Hence, some of the scholars have termed this hadith the Mother or Core of the Sunnah, just as Surah al-Fatiha has been termed the Mother or Core of the Qur'aan, due to it containing the entire Message of the Qur'an.\\n\\nThis hadith is also known as Hadith Jibreel (Angel Gabriel) (as). The hadith tells the story of Jibreel (as) when he came to the Prophet (sas), asking a set of questions. The Prophet (sas) responded to those questions and then addressed his companions. There is a door called “Baab Jibreel” at Masjid An-Nabawi in Madina. It is known as the door that Jibreel (as) came in to ask the Prophet (sas) these questions.\\n\\n# Awareness\\n\\nIt is very important for du’aat (Islamic workers ) to be aware of their surroundings, and to recognize what’s going on around them so they can act appropriately. Umar (ra) noticed that a well-kept individual with clean clothes, whom he didn’t know, entered the Masjid with no trace of travel on him. Umar (ra) was conscious; he could sense that this man was not an ordinary man, nor a man from “around town.”\\n\\nThe da’wah, the call to Islam, is very much predicated upon the building of relationships with people. The people who care about inviting others to Islam and spreading the deen of Allah (swt), should notice what’s going on around them. They should notice when someone new comes into the masjid. They should notice if someone is left out or if someone is sitting by him or herself. Then they can proceed from there in terms of figuring out how to deal with that situation. The call towards the deen of Allah is predicated upon brotherhood, sisterhood, love for the sake of Allah; and that requires paying attention to the situations of people around us.\\n\\n# Etiquette\\n\\nJibreel (as) came dressed in a very nice and clean way. He sat in front of the Prophet (pbuh) in a very respectful and humble way. There are many things that the scholars took from this Hadith in terms of seeking knowledge. Among the etiquettes of seeking knowledge is students should have decent apparel, they should look clean as much as possible. Moreover, they should show a high level of respect towards their teachers.\\n\\n# Outward Actions & Inward Beliefs\\n\\nJibreel (as) turns to the Prophet (sas) and says, “Tell me about Islam”. The Prophet’s answer was centered around outward actions. Then he asks him about iman and the Prophet’s answer focused on internal actions of belief and of thought.\\n\\nIslam and iman are interchangeable concepts revolved around the five pillars of action and the six foundations of belief. When Islam and iman are mentioned together in the same place, then Islam refers to the outward actions and iman refers to the inward beliefs.\\n\\nBelief manifests itself. The scholars say that a belief lives in the heart and shows itself on the actions and on the tongue. For example, the Prophet (sas) said that the Muslim is the person who the people are safe from his hands and his tongue. And the believer is the one who people trust him with their wealth and themselves.\\n\\n# The Big Three: Islam, Iman, & Ihsan\\n\\nScholars consider Islam, Iman and Ihsan the three stages in the path towards Allah (swt). The first path is you force yourself and bring yourself to do those actions which you know that Allah wants you to do. The second level is iman where you are not only doing those actions, but you are strengthening your relationship with Allah (swt) and you’re beginning to taste the sweetness of your relationship with Allah. The third level is the level of Ihsan, which is to worship Allah as if you see Him, and even if you cannot see Him, to know that He sees you. So, you are moving in this path, this journey, towards the Divine. And in doing so, it’s getting more and more intense.\\n\\n# The Hour\\n\\nWhen Jibreel asked the Prophet (sas) about the hour, He said, “The one who is being asked about it is not more knowledgeable about it than the one who is asking.” Here, the Prophet (sas) is saying, this is something that Allah (swt) keeps to Himself and it is part of the “ghayb” (unseen). This is an important lesson because it doesn’t matter when the Day of Judgment is, what really matters is what and how we are preparing for it. We should be continuously striving to please Allah and seek his forgiveness.\\n\\n# The Signs\\n\\nThe next question was, “So, tell me about it’s signs, tell me about the things that will occur”. These signs are considered as warnings. The Prophet (sas) gave two signs to this particular hadith of the end of time. One of them is, “the slave woman will give birth to her master,” and the tense is feminine so it is referring to her female master.\\n\\nOne of the interpretations that relates to modern time would be: The one who gives birth is supposed to be in power, or have some sort of level or authority over the one who she gives birth to. But this here is a flipping of the scale. The one who gives birth becomes the servant of the one who is born. Whereas before, the child would respect, honor and listen to their parents. Now it’s the complete opposite, and if you look around, you will see it. You see and feel as if the parents are slaves to the children. Parents desperately trying to please their children, and moms are trying to imitate their daughters.\\n\\nThe second sign; is the person will see barefooted, lightly dressed, and poor people who are shepherds. They will see these people competing with one another in their buildings. The point here is you have these people who don’t have anything, they are very poor. Then suddenly the situation changes for them, and they are competing with one another over who can build the tallest building. They are competing to see who has the nicest car, the latest gadgets, etc.\\n\\n# Bounty of Allah\\n\\nIn the end, all of this is from the blessings of Allah (swt). Allah (swt) gives us so much and rather than being humble and grateful in front of Allah, we are arrogant and think that it is all from us. Righteousness, putting full effort and trying one's best will all eventually lead to success and wealth. But at the end of the day, we still have to acknowledge that no matter how much effort we put in, our wealth and success will always be in the hands and bounty of Allah. So, being successful and having wealth should give us more reasons to increase our humility and increase our gratitude towards our Lord.\",video:\"https://youtube.com/embed/rGSXCH9ZvUY\",slug:\"2-islam-iman-ihsan\"},{title:\"Modesty is from Faith\",hadith_count:\"20\",date:\"2019-10-08T03:31:08.317Z\",hadith_source:'عَنْ أَبِي مَسْعُودٍ عُقْبَةَ بْنِ عَمْرٍو الْأَنْصَارِيِّ الْبَدْرِيِّ رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ قَالَ: قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه و سلم:\\n\\n> \"إنَّ مِمَّا أَدْرَكَ النَّاسُ مِنْ كَلَامِ النُّبُوَّةِ الْأُولَى: إذَا لَمْ تَسْتَحِ فَاصْنَعْ مَا شِئْت\" .\\r\\n\\n\\\\[رَوَاهُ الْبُخَارِيُّ].',hadith_english:\"Abu Mas'ud 'Uqbah bin 'Amr al-Ansari al-Badri(ra) reported that the Messenger of Allah(sas) said:\\r\\n\\n> “The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: ‘Among the early prophetic teachings that have reached people is this: if you do not feel shame, do what you wish.’ ”\\r\\n\\nRelated by Bukhari\",commentary:\"In society, there remains some faint traces of the earliest Prophetic teachings. Prophet Muhammad (sas) in this hadith reminds us of one of those teachings, while also conveying an important message about heeding our internal compass of haya’.\\r\\n\\nThe Arabic word used here is haya’, and is often translated as modesty. However, Haya’ is more complex and dynamic than just modesty and encompasses many shades of meaning, including humility, sensitivity, shyness, apprehensiveness, and shame.\\r\\n\\nWe know that all of the Prophets are interconnected. They came with the same message, a universal call to worship the one true God. The concept of haya’ is neither new and invented, nor exclusive to Islam. The Prophet (sas) said, “I was sent to perfect good character.” From this, we learn that good character and manners is a component of society, and earlier prophets also emphasized good moral character.\\r\\n\\n# Several Meanings\\r\\n\\nThe statement, “If you do not feel shame, do what you wish,” can be understood in several ways. The scholars give several explanations. It is interesting to consider that all of these meanings are true, and all of the meanings are possible simultaneously.\\r\\n\\nOne way to understand it is as a threat. Do whatever you want, but be prepared to face the consequences. Those who do not have a sense of shame may as well do whatever they want, since that haya’ is an indispensable condition of good character and piety. It can also be understood as a statement of fact. People who lack haya’ will simply do as they please. They have no internal limitations or barriers to engaging in whatever they want. This problem can manifest on two levels: on an individual level where someone is openly indecent and sinful, and on a community level where society as a whole normalizes and embraces immorality.\\r\\n\\nThe hadith can also be interpreted as a prescription from the Prophet. Believers can use their internal haya’ as a barometer to measure their actions. For actions that are not clearly forbidden, one way that we can check is by paying attention to our internal state. The Prophet (sas) said, “A sin is what becomes lodged in your chest, and what you hate for people to see you doing.” When a believer is faced with a choice, he or she can check for the feelings of haya’--shyness, shame, apprehensiveness, and worry. Would you feel ashamed if you were caught doing the action? If so, then refrain. If not, then do it hoping for Allah’s mercy.\\r\\n\\nIt is important to remember here that the reference is Islam, not necessarily the norms of the general public. Society may try to promote something as acceptable or not, but our core values are shaped by the word of Allah and the example of His Prophet. The interpretations and standards of morality may differ based on the environment, but the underlying principle never changes.\\r\\n\\n# Haya’ in Front of Allah\\r\\n\\nHaya’ is a compulsory and core value that should permeate our lives. It may be expressed in different ways depending on the context, but we should hold to the essence of this keystone quality. Haya’ should be a part of our relationship with Allah and should extend to all of our interactions.\\r\\n\\nAllah says in the Quran, “Do whatever you will. Indeed, He sees all that you do.” (Al-Fussilat 41:40) We worship Allah as though we see Him, because we know that although we can’t see Him, He sees us. Truly and deeply knowing Allah as Al-Baseer, the All-Seeing, should instill a deep sense of haya’ in front of Him. This is especially true of deeds that we perform when no human sees us. Many times, the company of other people suffices as a restraint in our actions. We worry about our image and what people think of us. The true test of haya’ lies in those actions which no one but Allah witnesses.\\r\\n\\nAllah created human beings with fitrah, natural inclinations. Our inborn fitrah can direct us towards haya’ and good morals. Our fitrah is programmed to feel an uneasiness when codes of morality are violated. The believer is most in touch with his or her fitrah, and is keen to act in accordance with this natural disposition. Haya’ is a quality that for some people comes naturally, and some may need to struggle to instill it in some aspect of their life. It’s possible to revive and kindle this great quality of haya’, just as it is possible to ruin by consistently neglecting it. Nurturing haya’ in our hearts is part of the process of our spiritual development and building our relationship with Allah.\",video:\"https://youtube.com/embed/cm0Cm6iNL9U\",slug:\"20-modesty-is-from-faith\"},{title:\"Say 'I believe in Allah' and then be Steadfast\",hadith_count:\"21\",date:\"2019-10-08T03:43:41.605Z\",hadith_source:'عَنْ أَبِي عَمْرٍو وَقِيلَ: أَبِي عَمْرَةَ سُفْيَانَ بْنِ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ قَالَ:\\n\\n>  \"قُلْت: يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ! قُلْ لِي فِي الْإِسْلَامِ قَوْلًا لَا أَسْأَلُ عَنْهُ أَحَدًا غَيْرَك؛ قَالَ: قُلْ: آمَنْت بِاَللَّهِ ثُمَّ اسْتَقِمْ\" \\n\\n\\\\[رَوَاهُ مُسْلِمٌ].',hadith_english:\"On the authority of Sufyan bin Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said:\\r\\n\\n> \\\"I said, 'O Messenger of Allah, tell me something about Islam which I can ask of no one but you.' He (peace be upon him) said, 'Say \\\"I believe in Allah\\\" — and then be steadfast.'\\\"\\r\\n\\n\\\\[Muslim]\",commentary:\"Keeping an upright and steadfast life is following the injunctions that have come from Allah, and leaving that which Allah has forbade.\\r\\n\\nThis hadith emphasizes the importance of proclaiming and saying with the tongue words of belief, as well as living by those words by acting in a manner that affirms one’s proclamation of faith in Allah\\r\\n\\n# Comprehensive Speech\\r\\n\\nThis Hadith is an example of the miracle of the Prophet’s comprehensiveness in speech (Jawami’ al-Kalam), as the Prophet(s) has combined for the questioner, in these two phrases “Say: I believe in Allah” and “then be steadfast”, the complete essence of one’s declaration of belief and application of Islam in one’s life through perseverance. These words instruct one to review one’s iman (faith) through the tongue and remembrance of the heart, and they instruct one to remain steadfast (to have istiqamah) upon performing the actions of obedience, and refraining completely from actions of disobedience.\\r\\n\\n# Belief and Action\\r\\n\\nThe Prophet(s) instructs the man _“Say: I believe in Allah, then be steadfast”_ as there is some value in him outwardly stating and restating his belief in Allah. It’s not enough to just say, but to actually follow through with action. Many times, we are very good at talking, but very weak at doing, practicing, and living by our words. Simply saying by the tongue does not absolve us of our responsibility of living by the words we say/proclaim (say or proclaim). The following verse in the Qur’an emphasizes this point:\\r\\n\\nإِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُوا۟ رَبُّنَا ٱللَّهُ ثُمَّ ٱسْتَقَٰمُوا۟ تَتَنَزَّلُ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ أَلَّا تَخَافُوا۟ وَلَا تَحْزَنُوا۟ وَأَبْشِرُوا۟ بِٱلْجَنَّةِ ٱلَّتِى كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ\\n\\n_“Indeed, those who have said, ‘Our Lord is Allah’ and then remained on a right course - the angels will descend upon them, \\\\[saying], ‘Do not fear and do not grieve but receive good tidings of Paradise, which you were promised.’” (Qur’an, Surah Fussilat, 41:30)_\\r\\n\\nUmar bin al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said, “They are steadfast upon the obedience of Allah, and they do not swerve away from that with the evasions of the fox.” This means they are firm upon what Allah has ordered from matters of belief, speech, and action. In addition, they consistently persist upon these orders of Allah.\\r\\n\\nإِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُوا۟ رَبُّنَا ٱللَّهُ ثُمَّ ٱسْتَقَٰمُوا۟ فَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ\\n\\n_“Indeed, those who have said, ‘Our Lord is Allah’, and then remained on a right course - there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.” (Qur’an, Surah al-Ahqaf, 46:13)_\\r\\n\\n\\r__\\n\\n# Relationship Between Istiqamah (Steadfastness) and Istighfaar (Seeking Forgiveness)\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nقُلْ إِنَّمَآ أَنَا۠ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُكُمْ يُوحَىٰٓ إِلَىَّ أَنَّمَآ إِلَٰهُكُمْ إِلَٰهٌ وَٰحِدٌ فَٱسْتَقِيمُوٓا۟ إِلَيْهِ وَٱسْتَغْفِرُوهُ ۗ وَوَيْلٌ لِّلْمُشْرِكِينَ\\n\\n_“Say, O \\\\[Muhammad], ‘I am only a man like you to whom it has been revealed that your god is but one God; so take a straight course to Him (be steadfast) and seek His forgiveness.’ And woe to those who associate others with Allah.” (Qur’an, Surah Fussilat, 41:6)_\\r\\n\\nThe verse informs us we are going to try to be steadfast, but at times we may encounter shortcomings. So, Istighfar (seeking forgiveness) is essential in the process of steadfastness and fulfilling our proclamation of faith.\\r\\n\\nAnas bin Malik reports the Prophet (sas) said: _“The belief of a servant will not be steadfast until his heart becomes steadfast, and his heart will not become steadfast until his tongue becomes steadfast”_. (Imam Ahmad)\\r\\n\\n# Having Istiqamah May Require Opposing Societal Norms & Culture\\r\\n\\nHaving Istiqamah, steadfastness in obeying Allah, may require one to differentiate and not practice the incorrect customs, traditions, and cultural practices of the people. Due to this, the Prophet(s) said, _“Be steadfast (in your actions) and do not count (your good actions, which may cause you to limit them). And know that the best of your actions is the Prayer, and none except the Believer takes care to maintain his wudu”_.\\r\\n\\nIt was said, “al-Istiqamah is a trait such that with it all the good qualities are perfected, and without it all are disfigured.” Al-Wasiti (rh).\",video:\"https://youtube.com/embed/cdFdBHhG67k\",slug:\"21-say-i-believe-in-allah-and-then-be-steadfast\"},{title:\"Entering Paradise\",hadith_count:\"22\",date:\"2019-10-08T03:52:26.866Z\",hadith_source:'عَنْ أَبِي عَبْدِ اللَّهِ جَابِرِ بْنِ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ الْأَنْصَارِيِّ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمَا: \"أَنَّ رَجُلًا سَأَلَ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه و سلم فَقَالَ:\\n\\n>  أَرَأَيْت إذَا صَلَّيْت الْمَكْتُوبَاتِ، وَصُمْت رَمَضَانَ، وَأَحْلَلْت الْحَلَالَ، وَحَرَّمْت الْحَرَامَ، وَلَمْ أَزِدْ عَلَى ذَلِكَ شَيْئًا؛ أَأَدْخُلُ الْجَنَّةَ؟ قَالَ: نَعَمْ\".\\r\\n\\n\\\\[رَوَاهُ مُسْلِمٌ].',hadith_english:'On the authority of Abu Abdullah Jabir bin Abdullah al-Ansari (may Allah be pleased with him):\\r\\n\\n> A man questioned the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and said: \"Do you think that if I perform the obligatory prayers, fast in Ramadan, treat as lawful that which is halal, and treat as forbidden that which is haram, and do not increase upon that \\\\[in voluntary good deeds], then I shall enter Paradise?\" He (peace be upon him) replied, \"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\n\\\\[Muslim]',commentary:\"In this hadith, the Prophet (sas) did not mention any of the voluntary acts, indicating that it is permissible to leave them. Scholars also state that the Prophet did not mention the voluntary acts to make the religion easy for the man. Especially since he had recently accepted Islam and over time, if he was sincere about his commitment, Allah (swt) would open his heart to perform these voluntary acts. Other scholars say the voluntary acts were not mentioned to prevent the man from wrongly assuming these actions were obligatory. \\\\[1,2,3]\\n\\n_A similar hadith states:_\\r\\n\\n_A man approached the Prophet and asked: “Tell me about an action that if I do, I will enter paradise?”_\\r\\n\\n_The Prophet said, “Worship Allah, do not associate partners, establish prayers, give zakat, and fast during Ramadan”._\\r\\n\\n_The man said, “By Allah, I will not increase anything from this and I will not decrease anything from this”._\\r\\n\\n_When the man left, the Prophet said if anyone is pleased to see a person from paradise then look to that man. Other hadiths include maintaining family ties and staying away from major sins._\\r\\n\\nThe meaning of these hadiths is clear: the minimum requirements for entering paradise are the Five Pillars of Islam, abiding by that which Allah has made permissible, and refraining from that which He has forbidden. An important lesson we can derive is not to overwhelm ourselves or new Muslims with too much information or actions. First gain the Islamic foundation, As we draw closer to Allah, we will then have the desire and ability to perform the voluntary acts alongside the obligatory ones. Also, the purpose of the voluntary acts are to help us become closer to Allah, and to compensate for any shortcomings in performing the obligatory ones.\\r\\n\\n# Personal Struggles and Opinions\\r\\n\\nAllah says in the Quran:\\r\\n\\n\\rٱلَّذِينَ ءَاتَيْنَٰهُمُ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ يَتْلُونَهُۥ حَقَّ تِلَاوَتِهِۦٓ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِۦ ۗ وَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِهِۦ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْخَٰسِرُونَ\\n\\n_“Those to whom We have given the Scripture, who follow it as it deserves, are the ones who truly believe in it.…” (Al Baqarah 2:121)_\\r\\n\\nOther verses state:\\r\\n\\n\\rيَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَا تُحَرِّمُوا۟ طَيِّبَٰتِ مَآ أَحَلَّ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَلَا تَعْتَدُوٓا۟ ۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُعْتَدِينَ (87)\\n\\nوَكُلُوا۟ مِمَّا رَزَقَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ حَلَٰلًا طَيِّبًا ۚ وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَنتُم بِهِۦ مُؤْمِنُونَ (88)\\n\\n_“You who believe, do not forbid the good things God has made lawful to you—do not exceed the limits: God does not love those who exceed the limits—but eat the lawful and good things that God provides for you.” (Al Ma’idah 5:87-88)_\\r\\n\\nBoth the hadith and the above Quranic verses are referencing those who permit that which Allah has made lawful and forbid that which Allah has made unlawful; In addition, these individuals do not change the meaning or context of a hadith or Quranic verse for any personal reasons. They accept what has been stated by Allah wholeheartedly, and it is they who will enter paradise.\\r\\n\\nHowever, sometimes we feel the need to appease the beliefs of others by compromising our own to fit in or to make ourselves feel better about something we do. This usually leads us to give our personal opinion instead of following the laws stated by Allah (swt). For example, some people will quote a hadith or verse and say it is okay to dress inappropriately, listen to explicit music, watch inappropriate shows, not maintain the correct boundaries with the opposite gender, take drugs, drink alcohol, etc. To be of those who will enter paradise, we cannot change the meaning or make our own opinions and decisions, Allah has clearly declared what is permissible and and what is forbidden.\\r\\n\\nIt is important, however, to acknowledge that we all have personal desires or inclination towards a certain action, as long as we struggle against ourselves from changing the meaning of the Quran and sunnah to justify our problems, then it is a personal struggle, or jihad. In the Quran, Allah swt says:\\r\\n\\n\\rوَٱلَّذِينَ جَٰهَدُوا۟ فِينَا لَنَهْدِيَنَّهُمْ سُبُلَنَا ۚ وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَمَعَ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ (69)\\n\\n_“\\\\[Allah is] sure to guide to Our ways those who strive hard for Our cause: God is with those who do good.” (Al Ankabut 29:69)_\\r\\n\\n# Common Misunderstandings\\r\\n\\nA common misunderstanding with this hadith is what the man means, and more importantly, what the man does not mean. The man is saying he will pray but only the obligatory prayers, give the mandatory charity (zakat), only fast during Ramadan, and make Hajj once; and it is in these actions that he will neither increase nor decrease. The man does not mean he will backbite, oppress people, abandon those who need help, and keep sinning while performing the minimum actions. He is still obligated to behave properly, fulfill his responsibilities and keep away from sinning.\\r\\n\\nAllah(swt) states:\\r\\n\\nإِن تَجْتَنِبُوا۟ كَبَآئِرَ مَا تُنْهَوْنَ عَنْهُ نُكَفِّرْ عَنكُمْ سَيِّـَٔاتِكُمْ وَنُدْخِلْكُم مُّدْخَلًا كَرِيمًا (31)\\n\\n_“If you avoid the great sins you have been forbidden, We shall wipe out your minor misdeeds and let you through the entrance of honor \\\\[Paradise].” (An’Nisa 4:31)_\\r\\n\\nThis verse indicates that major sins can prevent us from entering paradise, regardless of the actions we do. However, avoiding these sins and performing good deeds can erase the minor sins and enter us into Paradise.\\r\\n\\n# Major Sins preventing one from entering Paradise\\r\\n\\nAllah (swt) has informed us of the major sins that will prevent us from entering Paradise, these are:\\r\\n\\n* Committing shirk, associating partners with Allah\\r\\n* A highway robber\\r\\n* Harboring any amount of arrogance\\r\\n* Until one’s debt is forgiven or paid\\r\\n* A person whose neighbor is not safe from his mischief\\r\\n* One who has oppressed or wronged someone.  He will need to make amends to the person in this life, or the person wronged will get his right on the Day of Judgment.\\r\\n\\nThe early generation, at the Prophet’s time, also used to say that the believers will be held at the doors of paradise for 100 years for a sin they committed.\\r\\n\\nThis hadith indicates if a person fulfills the minimum requirements and avoids the forbidden acts, he has earned paradise. However, we are still obligated to fulfill our responsibilities, act properly, and keep away from sins. Also, voluntary actions are encouraged to help us get closer to Allah, make up for any shortcomings, and to wipe out minor sins.\\r\\n\\nSources:\\r\\n\\n\\\\[1], \\\\[2], and \\\\[3]: http://abdurrahman.org/sunnah/nawavi40explanation.html\",video:\"https://youtube.com/embed/WNQJTVsNIOA\",slug:\"22-entering-paradise\"},{title:\"Hastening to Do Good\",hadith_count:\"23\",date:\"2019-10-08T03:53:21.620Z\",hadith_source:'عَنْ أَبِي مَالِكٍ الْحَارِثِ بْنِ عَاصِمٍ الْأَشْعَرِيِّ رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ قَالَ: قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه و سلم \\n\\n> \"الطَّهُورُ شَطْرُ الْإِيمَانِ، وَالْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ تَمْلَأُ الْمِيزَانَ، وَسُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَالْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ تَمْلَآنِ -أَوْ: تَمْلَأُ- مَا بَيْنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ، وَالصَّلَاةُ نُورٌ، وَالصَّدَقَةُ بُرْهَانٌ، وَالصَّبْرُ ضِيَاءٌ، وَالْقُرْآنُ حُجَّةٌ لَك أَوْ عَلَيْك، كُلُّ النَّاسِ يَغْدُو، فَبَائِعٌ نَفْسَهُ فَمُعْتِقُهَا أَوْ مُوبِقُهَا\".\\r\\n\\n\\\\[رَوَاهُ مُسْلِمٌ].',hadith_english:'On the authority of Abu Malik al-Harith bin Asim al-Ashari (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:\\r\\n\\n> \"Purity is half of Iman.

The Hadith shows the importance of performing good deeds in Islam, through which every Muslim can free himself from the punishment of Allah (swt) in the Hereafter. This includes freeing oneself from servitude to anything other than Allah (swt).\\r\\n\\n# \\r\\n\\n# Purification is Half of Iman (faith)\\r\\n\\nThere are two ways to understand the meaning of “Purification is half of iman.” The first way to understand purification is in terms of physical cleanliness. Although Islam teaches cleanliness in all things, our homes and masajid are not always a reflection of this. We should strive for cleanliness in all things, whether it is keeping our homes clean or our masjids orderly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nThe word iman is also used to mean prayer, which reflects the importance of prayer as the foundation for iman (faith). Prayer is the distinguishing factor between belief and disbelief. When one goes to pray, they must first make wudu (abolution). Therefore, the second way to understand the concept of purification is that it is half of the prayer. A physical act of purification enables us to prepare for prayer externally and internally.\\r\\n\\n# \\r\\n\\n# The Significance of Dhikr (remembrance) of Allah\\r\\n\\nDhikr is the remembrance of God, often expressed through phrases such as “Al-Hamdulillah” (praise be to God) and “Subhanallah” (glory be to God). The hadith mentions that Al-Hamdulillah fills the mizan (scales), and the phrase “Subhanallah wa bihamdi” (exalted be Allah and to Him belongs all praise) fills the space between the heavens and the earth. The hadith shows the importance, greatness, and significance of dhikr for every Muslim. For example, merely reciting one phrase such as Subhanallah gives a reward that fills the heavens!\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nAl-Haithamy, one of the great Muslim scholars, stated that the full reward of reciting dhikr will be given to the person who recites these phrases while thinking of their meaning and submitting to their implication.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n# Salah (prayer) is a Light\\r\\n\\nThe Prophet (sas) said Prayer is a light by which we are guided spiritually. Knowing right and wrong is half the struggle, but the real struggle lies in the action of doing that which is right. Prayer is something that disciplines us spiritually so that we are able to correctly follow that which is pleasing to Allah. That is why prayer is the light that guides us through our journey towards Allah (swt).\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nSadaqah (charity) is a Proof\\r\\n\\nWhen one gives in charity, one is trusting in Allah’s promise that He will return the wealth in multifold. In a material sense, one may be losing money, but in a spiritual sense one is gaining reward. Allah (swt) says many times in the Quran that charity doesn’t diminish, but rather increases our wealth.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nCharity is a burhan (proof) for the Muslim. The term burhan literally means 'sunlight' in Arabic. This linguistic definition is adding a depth of meaning to the definition of burhan as a proof; it is not just a proof, it is a shining and clear proof of one’s iman as a Muslim. Imam Ibn Rajab said that the reason why charity is an evidence of iman, is that people usually love wealth, and if they overcome this love of material things for the sake of Allah, this is a clear proof of their strong iman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n# Sabr (patience) is a Shining Light\\r\\n\\nPatience is a shining, bright light that guides us in tough moments. It is always inspiring when we are around people who exercise patience in the face of adversity and difficulty.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nBeing patient requires a lot of internal effort and struggle. Overcoming impatience develops our self-control and accountability. Patience leads to self-control, which is the goal of al-sabr (patience).\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n# The Qur'an is Either Evidence For or Against You\\r\\n\\nSeeking knowledge is obligatory on every Muslim, and the core of all knowledge is the Quran. With knowledge comes responsibility. That is why the Prophet (sas) said that \\\"The Qur'an is either evidence for or against you.” People who recite, learn and practice the Qur'an, become the people of Quran and the Quran will be a proof for them. However, on the Day of Judgment, the Quran will stand against those who never read or practiced it in their lives.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n# Every Day is a New Opportunity\\r\\n\\nWe go out every day and Allah (swt) gives us life, energy and new opportunities to come closer to Him. Imam Ibn Rajab, while commenting on this meaning, said the person who struggles to worship Allah and obeys Him is the one who frees himself, while the person who indulges in sins is the one who destroys himself.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nEvery morning, when people go out of their homes, they are either gaining reward or suffering losses. If they work for Allah and obey Him, they are winners; but if they violate the rules of Allah and disobey Him, then they gain nothing but loss after loss.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n# Conclusion\\r\\n\\nThis hadith guides us in how to gain great rewards in our lives and also how to save ourselves from Allah's punishment. Practicing the acts of purification, dhikr, prayer, charity, and many other deeds are important ways to free oneself from the punishment of Allah.\",video:\"https://youtube.com/embed/ZXWZXrl9jI8\",slug:\"23-hastening-to-do-good\"},{title:\"The Forbiddance of Oppression\",hadith_count:\"24\",date:\"2019-10-08T03:56:13.998Z\",hadith_source:'عَنْ أَبِي ذَرٍّ الْغِفَارِيِّ رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ عَنْ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه و سلم فِيمَا يَرْوِيهِ عَنْ رَبِّهِ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى، أَنَّهُ قَالَ: \\n\\n> \"يَا عِبَادِي: إنِّي حَرَّمْت الظُّلْمَ عَلَى نَفْسِي، وَجَعَلْته بَيْنَكُمْ مُحَرَّمًا؛ فَلَا تَظَالَمُوا. يَا عِبَادِي! كُلُّكُمْ ضَالٌّ إلَّا مَنْ هَدَيْته، فَاسْتَهْدُونِي أَهْدِكُمْ. يَا عِبَادِي! كُلُّكُمْ جَائِعٌ إلَّا مَنْ أَطْعَمْته، فَاسْتَطْعِمُونِي أُطْعِمْكُمْ. يَا عِبَادِي! كُلُّكُمْ عَارٍ إلَّا مَنْ كَسَوْته، فَاسْتَكْسُونِي أَكْسُكُمْ. يَا عِبَادِي! إنَّكُمْ تُخْطِئُونَ بِاللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ، وَأَنَا أَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوبَ جَمِيعًا؛ فَاسْتَغْفِرُونِي أَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ. يَا عِبَادِي! إنَّكُمْ لَنْ تَبْلُغُوا ضُرِّي فَتَضُرُّونِي، وَلَنْ تَبْلُغُوا نَفْعِي فَتَنْفَعُونِي. يَا عِبَادِي! لَوْ أَنَّ أَوَّلَكُمْ وَآخِرَكُمْ وَإِنْسَكُمْ وَجِنَّكُمْ كَانُوا عَلَى أَتْقَى قَلْبِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ مِنْكُمْ، مَا زَادَ ذَلِكَ فِي مُلْكِي شَيْئًا. يَا عِبَادِي! لَوْ أَنَّ أَوَّلَكُمْ وَآخِرَكُمْ وَإِنْسَكُمْ وَجِنَّكُمْ كَانُوا عَلَى أَفْجَرِ قَلْبِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ مِنْكُمْ، مَا نَقَصَ ذَلِكَ مِنْ مُلْكِي شَيْئًا. يَا عِبَادِي! لَوْ أَنَّ أَوَّلَكُمْ وَآخِرَكُمْ وَإِنْسَكُمْ وَجِنَّكُمْ قَامُوا فِي صَعِيدٍ وَاحِدٍ، فَسَأَلُونِي، فَأَعْطَيْت كُلَّ وَاحِدٍ مَسْأَلَته، مَا نَقَصَ ذَلِكَ مِمَّا عِنْدِي إلَّا كَمَا يَنْقُصُ الْمِخْيَطُ إذَا أُدْخِلَ الْبَحْرَ. يَا عِبَادِي! إنَّمَا هِيَ أَعْمَالُكُمْ أُحْصِيهَا لَكُمْ، ثُمَّ أُوَفِّيكُمْ إيَّاهَا؛ فَمَنْ وَجَدَ خَيْرًا فَلْيَحْمَدْ اللَّهَ، وَمَنْ وَجَدَ غَيْرَ ذَلِكَ فَلَا يَلُومَن إلَّا نَفْسَهُ\".\\r\\n\\n\\\\[رَوَاهُ مُسْلِمٌ].',hadith_english:'On the authority of Abu Dharr Al-Ghafari, of the Prophet (peace be upon him) is that among the sayings he relates from his Lord is that He said:\\r\\n\\n> \"O My servants! I have forbidden oppression for Myself, and I have made it forbidden amongst you, so do not oppress one another. O My servants, all of you are astray except those whom I have guided, so seek guidance from Me and I shall guide you. O My servants, all of you are hungry except those whom I have fed, so seek food from Me and I shall feed you.

O My servants, you sommit sins by day and by night, and I forgive all sins, so seek forgiveness from Me and I shall forgive you. O My servants, you will not attain harming Me so as to harm Me, and you will not attain benefitting Me so as to benefit Me.

O My servants, it is but your deeds that I account for you, and then recompense you for. So he who finds good, let him praise Allah, and he who finds other than that, let him blame no one but himself.\"\\r\\n\\n\\\\[Muslim]',commentary:\"This hadith is a 'Hadith Qudsee', a Hadith where the Prophet (sas) narrated Allah’s (swt) words. This hadith stresses on the prohibition of all forms of injustice and oppression in Islam. It also encourages Muslims to seek guidance from Allah by means of supplication (du'a) and to rely solely on Allah, while highlighting Allah’s Glory and His inexhaustible treasures and bounties.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n# Unlawful Oppression\\r\\n\\nWhen Allah (swt) said, “I have made oppression unlawful for Me”, one might think of all the suffering, evil, and oppression that exists in the world. One might think, if Allah (swt) is Merciful, then why do these evil things occur? These things happen because Allah (swt) gave us free will and a choice to act according to what we think is right. We can deduce that it is human beings who choose to oppress one another, exercising their own free will.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nThe forbidden injustices can occur in many forms. The most extreme form of injustice is al-shirk, or associating partners with Allah. The second form is injustice towards one own self, by committing sins. The third form is injustice towards others, human beings, and other creations alike. Muslims should strive to avoid injustice, as it displeases Allah (swt) and warrants His severe punishment.\\r\\n\\n# \\r\\n\\n# Allah is the Source of Guidance\\r\\n\\nAllah (swt) is the source of all guidance. None of us can give guidance. We may attempt to show people the right path, but the true guidance comes from Allah (swt) alone. Guidance is a great mercy and blessingfrom Allah (swt). This guidance, in the form of the Qur'an, was revealed to us by Allah (swt) through His Messenger, Muhammad (sas). Allah (swt) showed us the right path to follow and warned us against Shaitan, who is our greatest enemy. Reciting Surah al-Fatihah every raka’ah reminds us of our extreme need for our Lord and His Guidance and Support.\\r\\n\\n# \\r\\n\\n# Allah is the Provider\\r\\n\\nWhen it comes to material goods, Allah (swt) is the One who provides us with what we need: food, clothing, etc. The hadith shows the generosity of Allah (swt). The more we ask Him, the more He gives us. He wants us to come closer to Him by expressing our needs with humility. Allah (swt) said: \\\"Do not seek sustenance from anyone other than Me, for verily all those others from whom you might seek sustenance have themselves been provided for by Myself. So seek sustenance from me and I will provide for you\\\".\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n# Allah is always willing to forgive us\\r\\n\\nAlthough we are constantly committing sins, Allah is constant in His Mercy and forgiveness. The door of repentance is always open for all. Allah (swt) acknowledges our weaknesses. People are always subject to wrongdoings. They may neglect or delay performing obligations or indulge in sins, but Allah (swt) is Oft-Forgiving and His door is open to all wrongdoers. If we do something wrong at night, we should come back to Him in the morning and vice versa.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n# Allah’s Treasures and Bounties are Endless\\n\\nAllah’s treasures are inexhaustible, so do not let anyone think that what is with Allah will diminish by His giving. The Prophet (sas) has explained in another Hadith: \\\"Allah's Hand is Full; it is not diminished by His giving all of the day and the night. Have you not seen that your Lord has been giving ever since He created the Heavens and the Earth, and all that has not diminished what is in His Hand by the least” (Bukhari).\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n# Accountability\\r\\n\\nAt the end of the hadith, it is mentioned and stressed that everyone will be accountable for their deeds. Whoever finds a good record, he should be thankful to Allah and praise Him for that. Anyone who finds other than that, should not blame anyone except himself. This is a clear statement that shows the personal responsibility we have for our actions.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n# Conclusion\\r\\n\\nIn many verses of the Qur'an and in the Hadiths of the Prophet (sas), the importance of expressing our need with humility to Allah (swt) is very clear. We should also constantly repent to him. Allah (swt) is The All Hearing, He will listen to us and accept our supplication and repentance. We seek of Him; His mercy, blessings and pleasure. The pleasure of Allah (swt) is our ultimate goal, without which we will indeed be among the unfortunate of creations. We ask Allah (swt) to count us among the winners, the ones who have earned His pleasure (Amin).\",video:\"https://youtube.com/embed/p3Iu5qC_t00\",slug:\"24-the-forbiddance-of-oppression\"},{title:\"The Value of Charity\",hadith_count:\"25\",date:\"2019-10-08T04:00:48.666Z\",hadith_source:'عَنْ أَبِي ذَرٍّ رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ:\\n\\n> \"نَاسًا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه و سلم قَالُوا لِلنَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه و سلم يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ ذَهَبَ أَهْلُ الدُّثُورِ بِالْأُجُورِ؛ يُصَلُّونَ كَمَا نُصَلِّي، وَيَصُومُونَ كَمَا نَصُومُ، وَيَتَصَدَّقُونَ بِفُضُولِ أَمْوَالِهِمْ. قَالَ: أَوَلَيْسَ قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ مَا تَصَّدَّقُونَ؟ إنَّ بِكُلِّ تَسْبِيحَةٍ صَدَقَةً، وَكُلِّ تَكْبِيرَةٍ صَدَقَةً، وَكُلِّ تَحْمِيدَةٍ صَدَقَةً، وَكُلِّ تَهْلِيلَةٍ صَدَقَةً، وَأَمْرٌ بِمَعْرُوفٍ صَدَقَةٌ، وَنَهْيٌ عَنْ مُنْكَرٍ صَدَقَةٌ، وَفِي بُضْعِ أَحَدِكُمْ صَدَقَةٌ. قَالُوا: يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ أَيَأْتِي أَحَدُنَا شَهْوَتَهُ وَيَكُونُ لَهُ فِيهَا أَجْرٌ؟ قَالَ: أَرَأَيْتُمْ لَوْ وَضَعَهَا فِي حَرَامٍ أَكَانَ عَلَيْهِ وِزْرٌ؟ فَكَذَلِكَ إذَا وَضَعَهَا فِي الْحَلَالِ، كَانَ لَهُ أَجْرٌ\".\\r\\n\\n\\\\[رَوَاهُ مُسْلِمٌ].',hadith_english:\"On the authority of Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him):\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n> \\\"Some people from amongst the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said to the Prophet (peace be upon him), 'O Messenger of Allah, the affluent have made off with the rewards; they pray as we pray, they fast as we fast, and they give \\\\[much] in charity by virtue of their wealth.'

Likewise, if he were to act upon it in a lawful manner, then he will be deserving of a reward.'\\\"\\r\\n\\n\\\\[Muslim]\",commentary:\"This hadith draws our attention to how the Companions sought to compete with one another for the hereafter and in seeking the reward of Allah (swt). The level of concern the Companions of the Prophet (sas) had to constantly seek opportunities to carry out good deeds is evident in this hadith. Although there is nothing wrong with wanting to be wealthy with the intention that we may give in charity and gain reward from Allah (swt), the Prophet (sas) directs our attention to how Allah (swt) has provided many ways a believer can give in charity regardless of one’s situation in life. Remembering Allah (swt), benefitting others and performing acts in a permissible way are all considered charity. Our concern should be seeking the Pleasure of Allah (swt) in as many ways as possible.\\n\\n# \\n\\n# Charity in a Comprehensive Sense\\n\\nThis hadith contains a number of points. The first is that the Companions of the Prophet (sas) were always constant in their quest to figure out the best way to worship Allah (swt), how they can improve their relationship with Allah (swt), and how they can carry out more righteous actions. In this hadith, these Companions are looking at the situation where they felt limited in their ability to give in charity (these Companions are from amongst the poor of the companions). They pray and fast as the wealthy Companions do, but when it comes to charity they don’t have the means to give as the rich do and come to the conclusion that the rich are beating them to attain good deeds in this regard.\\n\\nNote the things the Companions are focusing on. We often say Islam is not only about the acts of praying, fasting or giving charity. We say this so that people do not have a simplistic understanding of what Islam is. However, at the same time, we need to recognize that these acts are the foundations of spiritual development in Islam and are the foundations to increase in our closeness to Allah (swt). Because the Companions knew the importance of fasting, prayer and charity, they are telling the Prophet (sas) that these are the things that they focus on, but are concerned that that the rich have an edge on them when it comes to charity. The Prophet (sas) tells these Companions that Allah (swt) has given them many avenues to do charity. The Prophet (sas) reminds them that actions such as making dhikr (saying Alhamdulilah, subhana Allah, Allahu Akbar, etc), enjoining in the good, forbidding the evil, giving good speech, and (in a different narration) spending on one's family are all considered as acts of charity.\\n\\nThe important concept taught by the Prophet (sas) is the expanded definition of what it means to be a charitable person. We often look at ourselves and think “how can I be a charitable person? How can I be a person who has a spirit of giving and a spirit of compassion to those around me?” This hadith teaches us that it is not only through the giving of our wealth that we can achieve this. We see in another hadith that the Prophet (sas) expands our understanding of the definition of charity by saying that smiling is an act of charity and removing something from the road is charity and so on. Acting in a way that affects someone else in a positive way is considered as an act charity. All of these forms of charity are ways to get closer to Allah.\\n\\n# Expressing Things in a Permissible and Praiseworthy Way\\n\\nThe last point in this hadith is one that many people are shy to talk about but it deals with a concept rather than the particular act itself. There is something natural inside human beings towards the opposite gender and a natural tendency to desire affection and want to be loved. The Prophet (sas) tells his companions that there are two possibilities in how you can express that internal desire. Either you can express it in a way that is permissible or a way that is not. He (sas) is clarifying that as long as you express it in a way that is permissible, then that is also an act of charity and something you will be rewarded for. This is important because it changes the psychology of how we look at things. Many times when someone is told something is forbidden, the psychology of the person becomes “everything in Islam is negative”. Just as there are some things that are not allowed, there are many more things that are allowed. As long as we put our efforts in that which is permissible and praiseworthy then we get rewarded for it as long as we are purposely staying away from what is forbidden.\\n\\n# True Appreciation from Allah\\n\\nWithin human beings there is a natural desire to be appreciated. However, we are taught that there are many different ways in which we can go about achieving this:\\n\\n* \\n* You can be appreciated for doing bad things\\n* You can be appreciated through seeking the appreciation of people\\n* You can be appreciated by doing what you are supposed to do and know that Allah will recognize that good\\n\\nIt is more important to be appreciated by Allah than by the people. One of the consequences of doing what Allah wants from us is that we will be appreciated by people as well-but the beauty of it is that is merely a secondary consideration. The primary consideration is that obeying Allah (swt) to gain His love. When Allah loves us, as narrated in another hadith, He (swt) will tell Jebril (as) to love us and when Jebril (as) loves us then he will tell the other angels to love us and when they love us they will go and spread our love amongst the people on the earth. Within this example we see how to seek true popularity and true appreciation in a way that is praiseworthy and permissible according to the teaching of Islam.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nThe main message of this hadith is that many Companions were coming to the Prophet (sas) and saying they do not have the same opportunities as others when it comes to giving in charity. The Prophet (sas) corrects that understanding and expands on the definition of what it means to be a charitable person. There are many ways to worship Allah and gain His Pleasure and we should take advantage of all of these possibilities. If we do, then we will have the same potential to earn the reward of Allah (saw) as anyone else.\",video:\"https://youtube.com/embed/aheR2bk6h-o\",slug:\"25-the-value-of-charity\"},{title:\"What is Sadaqa?\",hadith_count:\"26\",date:\"2019-10-08T04:05:38.596Z\",hadith_source:'عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ قَالَ: قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه و سلم\\n\\n> \"كُلُّ سُلَامَى مِنْ النَّاسِ عَلَيْهِ صَدَقَةٌ، كُلَّ يَوْمٍ تَطْلُعُ فِيهِ الشَّمْسُ تَعْدِلُ بَيْنَ اثْنَيْنِ صَدَقَةٌ، وَتُعِينُ الرَّجُلَ فِي دَابَّتِهِ فَتَحْمِلُهُ عَلَيْهَا أَوْ تَرْفَعُ لَهُ عَلَيْهَا مَتَاعَهُ صَدَقَةٌ، وَالْكَلِمَةُ الطَّيِّبَةُ صَدَقَةٌ، وَبِكُلِّ خُطْوَةٍ تَمْشِيهَا إلَى الصَّلَاةِ صَدَقَةٌ، وَتُمِيطُ الْأَذَى عَنْ الطَّرِيقِ صَدَقَةٌ\".\\r\\n\\n\\\\[رَوَاهُ الْبُخَارِيُّ]\\r، \\\\[وَمُسْلِمٌ].',hadith_english:'Abu Hurairah (ra) reported that the Messenger of Allah (sas) said,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n> \"Every joint of a person must perform a charity each day that the sun rises: to judge justly between two people is a charity. To help a man with his mount, lifting him onto it or hoisting up his belongings onto it, is a charity. And the good word is a charity. And every step that you take towards the prayer is a charity, and removing a harmful object from the road is a charity.\"\\r\\n\\nRelated by Bukhari & Muslim',commentary:\"This hadith elaborates on the different forms of charity. There are three hundred and sixty joints in the human body and charity is due upon each one as a form of gratitude to Allah (swt). Being able to be just between individuals, walking towards the masjid for prayer, and removing harmful objects from the road are all considered as acts of charity.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n# Fulfilling Gratitude Through Charity\\r\\n\\nEvery person’s joints and bones have a responsibility on them every day. Thus, performing charity for this blessing extends into the concept of gratitude. Allah (swt) has given us many blessings, including our bones, our joints, and the way our body comes together. The fact that they do so in the most beautiful and amazing way means that there is charity due upon us. This charity is an act of gratitude for what Allah (swt) has given us. Gratitude is not something only said by the tongue or felt by the heart, but something that manifests itself in one’s actions.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n# Reconciliation Between two People\\r\\n\\nThe Prophet (sas) mentions in this hadith that to reconcile and be just between two people is an act of charity. This can sometimes be difficult because you might be in the middle of a conflict or situation and there are biased considerations because of the people involved. You might have relations or a responsibility to one or the other. Therefore, it becomes more difficult to be just. Maybe one person is richer, one is more powerful, one is a friend, or even one might be from your country. However, putting aside these points and being just between people is an act of charity.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n# Assisting Individuals\\r\\n\\nIn modern days, helping someone with “their animal” is in relation to our cars. Acts such as opening the car door for a person or carrying something to their car is considered charity. As society spreads out even more and people become more distrustful of others, they may look at these actions as strange. However, as a general principle, if we see someone who could use some help, we should help them. If you can help individuals cross the street or carry some groceries for people, then do so. Keep in mind that this does not apply to strangers only. You should help your family and others you know as well. These are important etiquettes Sheikh Abdel Fattah Abu Ghuddah mentioned in his book, Islamic Manners. He mentions that the people that are the most beloved to you are the ones who are the most deserving of these manners. He also states that most people are lax with the ones they love but they should have the highest standard of character from you. Thus, to assist people is not only for strangers, but also for our families.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n# A Good Word is Charity\\r\\n\\nSaying a good word is very powerful and can really positively change people’s lives, as well as their days, just as a bad word can have the opposite effect. Saying a good word is a powerful and noble thing that should be practiced. If we practice the art of saying the right thing at the right time, then eventually we can be that kind of person. If we practice saying whatever we want and whenever we feel like it, without any consideration of the consequences, then we will be that kind of person. Thus, we should seek to engage in saying good words.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n# Steps Towards the Prayer\\r\\n\\nEvery step we take towards the prayer is considered an act of charity. In the modern context, every rotation of the tire or every bit of road that you cross in order to get to the masjid is an act of charity. This also takes care of the gratitude.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n# Clearing the Pathways\\r\\n\\nThe last point mentioned in this hadith is that to remove something from the road is considered charity. This is more common than we might think, since there are things that fall onto the road all the time that we can easily remove. If you attend the masjid, a good thing you can do to remove harmful things from the pathway is to take the slippers and shoes out of the hallway. It is a good opportunity to get charity by clearing the pathways in the house of worship.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n# Conclusion\\r\\n\\nThis hadith is another way that the Prophet (sas) is reminding us of gratitude to Allah (swt). He gives us multiple avenues by which we can show our gratitude and multiple avenues where we can be charitable. These include assisting people, saying something nice, clearing something harmful from the pathway, and more.\",video:\"https://youtube.com/embed/39KMoVqBwNM\",slug:\"26-what-is-sadaqa\"},{title:\"Righteousness is in Good Character\",hadith_count:\"27\",date:\"2019-10-08T04:23:42.791Z\",hadith_source:'عَنْ النَّوَّاسِ بْنِ سَمْعَانَ رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ عَنْ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه و سلم قَالَ:\\n\\n>  \"الْبِرُّ حُسْنُ الْخُلُقِ، وَالْإِثْمُ مَا حَاكَ فِي صَدْرِك، وَكَرِهْت أَنْ يَطَّلِعَ عَلَيْهِ النَّاسُ\" رَوَاهُ مُسْلِمٌ\"\\n\\n \\\\[رَوَاهُ مُسْلِمٌ]\\n\\nوَعَنْ وَابِصَةَ بْنِ مَعْبَدٍ رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ قَالَ:\\n\\n>  أَتَيْت رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه و سلم فَقَالَ: \"جِئْتَ تَسْأَلُ عَنْ الْبِرِّ؟ قُلْت: نَعَمْ. فقَالَ: استفت قلبك، الْبِرُّ مَا اطْمَأَنَّتْ إلَيْهِ النَّفْسُ، وَاطْمَأَنَّ إلَيْهِ الْقَلْبُ، وَالْإِثْمُ مَا حَاكَ فِي النَّفْسِ وَتَرَدَّدَ فِي الصَّدْرِ، وَإِنْ أَفْتَاك النَّاسُ وَأَفْتَوْك\" .\\r\\n\\nحَدِيثٌ حَسَنٌ، رَوَيْنَاهُ في مُسْنَدَي الْإِمَامَيْنِ أَحْمَدَ بْنِ حَنْبَلٍ \\\\[رقم:4/227]، وَالدَّارِمِيّ \\\\[2/246] بِإِسْنَادٍ حَسَنٍ.',hadith_english:\"On the authority of an-Nawas bin Sam'an (may Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n> \\\"Righteousness is in good character, and wrongdoing is that which wavers in your soul, and which you dislike people finding out about.\\\"\\r\\n\\n\\\\[Muslim]\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nAnd on the authority of Wabisah bin Ma'bad (may Allah be pleased with him) who said,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n> \\\"I came to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and he (peace be upon him) said, 'You have come to ask about righteousness.'

Bir is what encourages people to perform righteous actions, and is associated with Al-Abraar - righteous, pious people who are obedient to Allah (swt).\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nBir encompasses many characteristics: justice in one’s dealings, kindness, consideration in one’s endeavors, being generous in offering help, as well as other traits of the believers whom Allah (swt) has described by saying:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\r\\n\\nبِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ قَدْ أَفْلَحَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ (1)\\n\\nٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ فِى صَلَاتِهِمْ خَٰشِعُونَ (2)\\n\\nوَٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ عَنِ ٱللَّغْوِ مُعْرِضُونَ (3)\\n\\nوَٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ لِلزَّكَوٰةِ فَٰعِلُونَ (4)\\n\\nوَٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ لِفُرُوجِهِمْ حَٰفِظُونَ (5)\\n\\nإِلَّا عَلَىٰٓ أَزْوَٰجِهِمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَٰنُهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ غَيْرُ مَلُومِينَ (6)\\n\\nفَمَنِ ٱبْتَغَىٰ وَرَآءَ ذَٰلِكَ فَأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْعَادُونَ (7)\\n\\nوَٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ لِأَمَٰنَٰتِهِمْ وَعَهْدِهِمْ رَٰعُونَ (8)\\n\\nوَٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ عَلَىٰ صَلَوَٰتِهِمْ يُحَافِظُونَ (9)\\n\\nأُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْوَٰرِثُونَ (10)\\n\\n\\n\\n_\\\"Successful indeed are the believers. Those who offer their Salat with all solemnity and full submissiveness. And those who turn away from Al-Laghuw (dirty, false, evil, vain talk). And those who pay the Zakat. And those who guard their chastity. Except from their wives or (the captives and slaves) that their right hands possess, for then, they are free from blame; but whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors; those who are faithfully true to their Amanat (all the duties which Allah has ordained, honesty, trusts, etc.) and to their covenants; and those who strictly guard their (five compulsory congregational) Salawat (prayers) (at their fixed stated hours). These are indeed the inheritors \\\\[of Paradise].\\\" \\\\[Surah al-Mu'minoon, 23:1-10]_\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nWhoever is unsure of his condition, he should measure these characteristics within himself; if he finds in himself these good qualities, then this is a sign of possessing good character. If he finds that he does not possess any of these characteristics, this is a sign of bad character. If he finds only some of them, then he should strive to retain what he possesses and to obtain what he does not.\\r\\n\\n# \\r\\n\\n# Sin is What Wavers or Trembles Your Soul\\r\\n\\nSin causes aversion or dislike in the heart; it is that thing which wavers in the breast, and the individual hates that people should come to know of it. The commentators of this hadith stress that the 'people' referred to in this hadith are respected and righteous people. Ustadh Jamaludin Zarabozo states that in this hadith, the Prophet (saws) gave very important signs of sin. The first one is an internal sign within the human being: a feeling of aversion in the soul with respect to the particular act. The second sign also involves internal feelings, but deals with the outward reaction to the act itself: sin causes a wholesome soul to be uneasy and troubled. These signs occur because a person is naturally disposed to favor what leads to positive results and avoid what leads to negative results.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n# Consult Your Heart\\r\\n\\nAllah has created us with a pure, innate disposition that is called fitra. This means to love the truth and the good, and to hate falsehood and evil. Consequently, good believers with pure fitra should never confuse truth with falsehood.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nTo develop the capacity of knowing right from wrong in your heart, you have to realize that what’s good in your heart can be affected by what you consume in terms of ideas and knowledge. So the more you know about the Prophet (sas) - who he was, how he acted in different situations - the more you will be able to distinguish right from wrong. Get to know the Prophet (sas) so you know how he will act in any context.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nThe second hadith guides us to consult our heart regarding doubtful matters. If the heart is tranquil, that implies that it has bir or righteousness. If the heart is not tranquil when approaching an act, one should abstain from carrying out the act or doubtful matter. However, it should be noted that fitra is subject to corruption and can be spoiled due to the influence of a bad environment - a person may start to like and appreciate what is bad or evil, and dislike truth and goodness. Here, the heart is diseased or even dead. Such a person cannot use his heart as a measure to judge what is good and bad because the fitra is already corrupted.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nProphet Muhammad (sas) said even if other people over and over again give their opinion, yet you still have that feeling in your heart, even with their badgering or reassurance, your fitra is what is giving you that feeling and that is a sign of what you should do. The fact that they keep pushing you, and your soul still waivers, is proof that this is something wrong. Even if you’re uneasy and the thing you were considering turns out to be permissible, it’s best to follow your heart in that gray area.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n# The Internal Controlling and Guiding System\\r\\n\\nThese two ahadith reveal a significant aspect of Islam: our internal guiding system. This system is established as a result of several factors:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n* The pure fitra (natural disposition). Allah created everybody with a pure fitra, not just Muslims. The Prophet (sas) mentions many factors in the environment that play an influential role in subjecting the fitra to corruption.\\r\\n* The realization of tawhid (Oneness of Allah). This means practicing all the essentials of tawhid like loving Allah, seeking His Help as the only refuge, depending on Him (tawakul), asking for His Mercy, and many other essentials associated with the idea of tawhid.\\r\\n* Adhering to shari'ah instructions.\\r\\n* Seeking knowledge.\\r\\n* Tazkiyah and tarbiyah - that is the purification of the soul and the heart of the Muslim.\\r\\n\\nThese factors, along with many others, are interrelated and lead to the establishment of the internal controlling system. However, this system needs to be 'updated' and 'upgraded' regularly by educators and da'ies. It is very important that educators and da'ies pay attention to the individual's and the community's built-in system. They have to create awareness about contemporary challenges. They should plan future strategies to deal with such challenges.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nOnly through such proper reconstruction of the consciousness can we be certain about the validity and effectiveness of the internal controlling system. Muslims need to be aware of this fact, and activate their system in order to be sensitive towards doubtful acts and sinful matters. Unless this system is 'upgraded', the person may not act in the right way. It is like installing 'anti-virus software' within ourselves: with such software in place, our internal system will prevent 'viruses', i.e. bad/evil acts, from entering our thoughts or hearts.\",video:\"https://youtube.com/embed/9uHj70xcWk4\",slug:\"27-righteousness-is-in-good-character\"},{title:\"The Obligation of Following the Sunnah\",hadith_count:\"28\",date:\"2019-10-08T04:25:13.183Z\",hadith_source:'عَنْ أَبِي نَجِيحٍ الْعِرْبَاضِ بْنِ سَارِيَةَ رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ قَالَ:\\n\\n>  \"وَعَظَنَا رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه و سلم مَوْعِظَةً وَجِلَتْ مِنْهَا الْقُلُوبُ، وَذَرَفَتْ مِنْهَا الْعُيُونُ، فَقُلْنَا: يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ! كَأَنَّهَا مَوْعِظَةُ مُوَدِّعٍ فَأَوْصِنَا، قَالَ: أُوصِيكُمْ بِتَقْوَى اللَّهِ، وَالسَّمْعِ وَالطَّاعَةِ وَإِنْ تَأَمَّرَ عَلَيْكُمْ عَبْدٌ، فَإِنَّهُ مَنْ يَعِشْ مِنْكُمْ فَسَيَرَى اخْتِلَافًا كَثِيرًا، فَعَلَيْكُمْ بِسُنَّتِي وَسُنَّةِ الْخُلَفَاءِ الرَّاشِدِينَ الْمَهْدِيينَ، عَضُّوا عَلَيْهَا بِالنَّوَاجِذِ، وَإِيَّاكُمْ وَمُحْدَثَاتِ الْأُمُورِ؛ فَإِنَّ كُلَّ بِدْعَةٍ ضَلَالَةٌ\".\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\\\[رَوَاهُ أَبُو دَاوُدَ]، وَاَلتِّرْمِذِيُّ \\\\[رقم:266] وَقَالَ: حَدِيثٌ حَسَنٌ صَحِيحٌ.',hadith_english:'It was narrated on the authority of Abu Najih al-Irbad bin Sariyah (ra) who said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n> \"The Messenger of Allah (sas) delivered an admonition that made our hearts fearful and our eyes tearful. We said, \"O Messenger of Allah, it is as if this were a farewell sermon, so advise us.\" He said, \"I enjoin you to have Taqwa of Allah and that you listen and obey, even if a slave is made a ruler over you. He among you who lives long enough will see many differences. So for you is to observe my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly-principled and rightly-guided successors, holding on to them with your molar teeth. Beware of newly-introduced matters, for every innovation (bid\\'ah) is an error.\"\\r\\n\\n(Abu Dawud & Al-Tirmidhi, who says it is an authentic hadith - hasan saheeh)',commentary:\"# Introduction\\r\\n\\nIt was the practice of the Prophet (sas) to give admonition to his companions from time to time, however, without burdening or boring them. The Prophet (sas) was very eloquent. Ibn Rajab points out the characteristics of the Prophet's speeches and admonitions: brief, concise, and conveyed in beautiful understandable manner. He (sas) had the ability to deliver a very powerful message in a very impactful manner. That is why his companions said that their hearts became fearful and their eyes became tearful. When the companions experienced that, their response was to ask him for advice because this sermon seemed like a farewell sermon.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n# Having Taqwa of Allah\\r\\n\\nThe Prophet (sas) told his companions \\\"I enjoin you to have Taqwa of Allah”. Having Taqwa means is to have this God consciousness and awareness of God in all affairs. Having Taqwa is a pinnacle issue. If someone is able to have God consciousness in all of their affairs then they will be able to live the life of righteousness, devotion and submission to the teachings of Islam.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n# Listening and Obeying the Rulers\\r\\n\\nThe Prophet’s second advice was “that you listen and obey, even if a slave is made a ruler over you.” The Prophet (sas) emphasizes on the importance and respect for order. Listening and obeying will lead to better management of the affairs of the community, of peace and unity. However, the hadith lays a fact that rightly-guided leadership will be the first Islamic concept to be violated. The Prophet (sas) is informing us that the leadership will become corrupt, and will be given to other than its rightful owners. Also He informed us the leadership might be given to a slave. So if this were to occur then still listen and obey, in order to secure the lesser of two evils, which are putting up with a Ruler who rules without right, or bringing about chaos and a great fitnah through revolt.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n# Adhering to the Sunnah\\r\\n\\nThe Prophet’s third advice was “observe my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly-principled and rightly-guided successors.” The Prophet (sas) informed his companions of that which was to occur after him of differences and the spreading of evil. Not only he warned them about these evils but he also gave them the advice on how to face them. Following the Sunnah of the Prophet (sas) is the key to facing all evils. When the prophet says follow my Sunnah he is saying follow my way, and his way is how the Qur’an should be applied in real life.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nThe Prophet's (sas) actions may be classified as follows:\\r\\n\\n1. Those that is specific to the Prophet (sas), such as continuous fasting (wisal).\\r\\n2. Actions that are related to the culture of his time, such as the turban, keeping long hair or using a walking stick.\\r\\n3. Actions resulting from spontaneous or haphazard actions. For example, the Prophet, (sas), used to stop at particular places during a journey or take a certain route for a journey.\\r\\n4. Actions that the Prophet, (sas) performed intentionally for the purpose of ibadah.\\r\\n\\nScholars state that Muslims are only obliged to follow the last type of action. Note:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nAn act is considered an ibadah if there are authentic hadiths mentioning that the act is an ibadah, or that it will be rewarded, or that the one who does it is praised, or that the one who does not perform it is blamed or cursed or will be punished.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nThe Prophet (sas) also ordered his companions to hold on to the Sunnah of the rightly-principled and rightly-guided that will come after him (sas). The Prophet (sas) asked us to follow them because he (sas) knows that there are new issues and situations that will arise. That is why we have to seek the guidance from people who are known to be righteous, people who are known to follow the Sunnah of the Prophet and people who are able to give sound Fatwas in light of the Qur’an and Sunnah.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n# Beware of Newly-Introduced Matters, for every Innovation (bid'ah) is an Error\\r\\n\\nThe Prophet (sas) here is talking about the innovations that have to do with worship and the teachings of Islam. The innovations that are rejected are rejected because they are acts of worship that truly doesn’t have any foundations in the teachings of Islam. These acts will lead one after another to distortion of the faith and will lead people to worshiping in ways that are not acceptable.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nNewly invented matters are of two types:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n1. That matter which has no basis in the Sharee'ah, and this is baatil \\\\[rejected] and blameworthy.\\r\\n2. That matter which has a parallel or similarity in the Sharee'ah, then this is not blameworthy.\\r\\n\\nThis is because the words 'newly invented matter' and 'bid'ah' are not deemed blameworthy purely on the basis of the words themselves, but due to their indicating opposition to the Sunnah and calling towards misguidance. So someimes they are not considered to be unrestrictedly wrong. For example, 'Umar (rAa) reinstated the Taraaweeh Prayer and said \\\"What an excellent bid'ah is this.\\\" The Prophet (sas) had led the Taraaweeh Prayer in congregation for a few days, but then discontinued it due to his fear that the people would think it obligatory. This condition remained throughout the Khilaafah of Abu Bakr (rAa), until 'Umar (rAa) restarted what the Prophet (sas) had already laid a precedent for.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nSummary\\r\\n\\n* That the first thing advised is to fear Allaah (ie to have taqwaa)\\r\\n* That obedience is due to the rulers, no matter who becomes so (as long he fulfills its conditions)\\r\\n* That there will be controversy and difference of opinion after the Messenger (sas)\\r\\n* That in all cases of difference it is obligatory to stick to the Sunnah, the way of the Messenger (sas) and to the way of the Sunnah of the rightly-principled and rightly-guided\\r\\n* That one must be extremely careful about new things in the Deen\\r\\n* That one must ensure that everything that one does as part of his religion indeed has proof for it in the Qur'an and Sunnah\",video:\"https://youtube.com/embed/XvaDptZX4Aw\",slug:\"28-the-obligation-of-following-the-sunnah\"},{title:\"Means of Goodness\",hadith_count:\"29\",date:\"2019-10-08T04:28:32.296Z\",hadith_source:'عَنْ مُعَاذِ بْنِ جَبَلٍ رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ قَالَ:\\n\\n>  قُلْت يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ! أَخْبِرْنِي بِعَمَلٍ يُدْخِلُنِي الْجَنَّةَ وَيُبَاعِدْنِي مِنْ النَّارِ، قَالَ: \"لَقَدْ سَأَلْت عَنْ عَظِيمٍ، وَإِنَّهُ لَيَسِيرٌ عَلَى مَنْ يَسَّرَهُ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ: تَعْبُدُ اللَّهَ لَا تُشْرِكْ بِهِ شَيْئًا، وَتُقِيمُ الصَّلَاةَ، وَتُؤْتِي الزَّكَاةَ، وَتَصُومُ رَمَضَانَ، وَتَحُجُّ الْبَيْتَ، ثُمَّ قَالَ: أَلَا أَدُلُّك عَلَى أَبْوَابِ الْخَيْرِ؟ الصَّوْمُ جُنَّةٌ، وَالصَّدَقَةُ تُطْفِئُ الْخَطِيئَةَ كَمَا يُطْفِئُ الْمَاءُ النَّارَ، وَصَلَاةُ الرَّجُلِ فِي جَوْفِ اللَّيْلِ، ثُمَّ تَلَا: \" تَتَجَافَى جُنُوبُهُمْ عَنِ الْمَضَاجِعِ \" حَتَّى بَلَغَ \"يَعْمَلُونَ\"،\\\\[ 32 سورة السجدة / الأيتان : 16 و 17 ] ثُمَّ قَالَ: أَلَا أُخْبِرُك بِرَأْسِ الْأَمْرِ وَعَمُودِهِ وَذُرْوَةِ سَنَامِهِ؟ قُلْت: بَلَى يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ. قَالَ: رَأْسُ الْأَمْرِ الْإِسْلَامُ، وَعَمُودُهُ الصَّلَاةُ، وَذُرْوَةُ سَنَامِهِ الْجِهَادُ، ثُمَّ قَالَ: أَلَا أُخْبِرُك بِمَلَاكِ ذَلِكَ كُلِّهِ؟ فقُلْت: بَلَى يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ ! فَأَخَذَ بِلِسَانِهِ وَقَالَ: كُفَّ عَلَيْك هَذَا. قُلْت: يَا نَبِيَّ اللَّهِ وَإِنَّا لَمُؤَاخَذُونَ بِمَا نَتَكَلَّمُ بِهِ؟ فَقَالَ: ثَكِلَتْك أُمُّك وَهَلْ يَكُبُّ النَّاسَ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ -أَوْ قَالَ عَلَى مَنَاخِرِهِمْ- إلَّا حَصَائِدُ أَلْسِنَتِهِمْ؟!\" .\\r\\n\\nرَوَاهُ التِّرْمِذِيُّ \\\\[رقم:2616] وَقَالَ: حَدِيثٌ حَسَنٌ صَحِيحٌ.',hadith_english:\"On the authority of Muadh bin Jabal (may Allah be please with him) who said:\\r\\n\\n> I said, 'O Messenger of Allah, tell me of an act which will take me into Paradise and will keep me away from the Hellfire.'

Jamaal Diwan's audio commentary above and English translation of Ibn Daqiq Al-Id's commentary on The Forty Hadith of Imam al-Nawawi._\\n\\nThis hadith focuses on the five pillars of Islam. The Prophet (sas) describes the foundations of Islam as having been “built upon five.” These foundational actions are either of the tongue, heart or otherwise.\\n\\nImagine a home above the ocean, with five pillars that reach to the ground to support the home above. That is the imagery that comes to mind when the Prophet (sas) talks about these five aspects upon which Islam is built.\\n\\n\\n\\n# 1. Shahadah: The Declaration of Faith\\n\\nThe Shahadah is a beautiful, profound, yet simple statement which brings one into Islam. All the person has to say is: “La ilaha illa Allah, Muhammad rasulAllah.” “I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship but God, and I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of God.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThese few words in themselves are very powerful and sometimes we don’t realize that. We think about all the details in Islam, all of the sayings of the Prophet (pbuh), and many times we forget the Quran. Sometimes we become concerned about legal rulings and we forget that “La ilaha illa Allah Muhammad rasul Allah” is really the foundation of everything. It is an absolute commitment to worship nothing other than Allah and to put all of one’s reliance on Allah, and to follow the Prophet (pbuh) as His Messenger, who was sent to mankind to embody the divine message just as other Prophets before Him.\\n\\n\\n\\n# 2. Establishing Prayer\\n\\nThe second pillar of Islam, after the declaration of faith, is the establishment of prayer. It is very interesting terminology that is used in “the establishment of prayer.” The verb used in Arabic implies effort. The verb is “to establish,” as if one is making something stand. Essentially you are making something stand, so you are making your prayer stand, you are making the prayer happen; you are pushing it to a curve, you are sticking with it, and you are leaning upon it. It is also a foundation for your relationship with Allah.\\n\\nIt is important that we make the effort and we put forth the proper means in order to pray our prayers on time. One of the easiest effort is to make the intention to always make the prayers at the beginning of their time.\\n\\n\\n\\n# 3. Paying the Zakaah (Obligatory Charity)\\n\\nThe third pillar of Islam is foundational. Allah (swt) describes the believers in Surah Al-Mu’minun as those who observe and establish the institution of Zakaah in society:\\n\\n“And they who are observant of Zakah.” (The Quran 23:4)\\n\\nAllah has made it obligatory on the Muslims to pay a certain percentage , 2.5%, in Zakaah when their wealth exceeds a minimum amount and a year has passed since that amount has been accumulated. It could be gold, silver, or any sort of wealth.\\n\\n\\n\\n# 4. Making Pilgrimage to the House of Allah (Hajj)\\n\\nHajj is to make pilgrimage to the house of Allah, the Kabah, in Mecca to perform the traditional rights that were performed by the Prophet (sas).

Jamaal Diwan's audio commentary above and English translation of Ibn Daqiq Al-Id's commentary on The Forty Hadith of Imam al-Nawawi._\\n\\nThis hadith is among many of the miracles in the life of the Prophet (sas). It gives unwavering credibility to the revelation of the words of Allah (swt): the Quran.\\n\\nThis hadith sums up the life of man from nothingness, showing the early relationship between the physical and the spiritual components of human existence, the encounter between a piece of flesh (mudgha) upon which the spirit (ruh) is breathed. Man must then navigate through a predetermined course of life (Al Qadaa wal Qadar), at constant risk of wavering in his actions, with significant consequences for him on his return to nothingness at death.\\n\\nThis hadith presents the physical and abstract components of man by its depiction of the embryonic stages of life and the explanation of predestination.\\n\\n# Proof for Truth\\n\\nThe narrator Abdullah ibn Mas’ud (ra) starts this hadith with a comment on the truthfulness of the Prophet (sas) as proof for the authenticity of the content of the narration. During the time of the Prophet (sas), the attribute of Al-Amin (the trustworthy one) was the reason for his followers’ belief in the message he was spreading. In recent times, the confirmation of the hadith’s contents and the Quranic texts on the same issue (Chapter 23 verse 14) as described by modern science should remove any doubt in anyone’s mind about the authenticity of the message of Islam and its messenger.\\n\\n# Truth behind the Seen and Unseen\\n\\nWe can proceed to examine the concept of Al-Qadaa Wal Qadar, or predestination. The hadith talks about the spiritual encounter between the flesh-like human and the angel who conveys Allah’s decree of the four most important things: provision, lifespan, deeds and the abode in the afterlife: Paradise or Hell-Fire.\\n\\nThe Qadaa Wal Qadar is dictated in the \\\"Lawh al-Mahfudh”, the preserved tablet where Allah (swt) has written the predestination of his creation, and will manifest itself physically throughout the course of one's life. Every human will enjoy the sustenance that Allah has decreed for him. Each will be a witness to how his life is spent. At the exact moment of death, it is again a physical encounter as we learn from other narrations that the human will see the Angel of death when he arrives to take his soul. Even though this moment is very physical for him, he is unable to share its experiences nor recount it to another human. This ultimately brings us back again to the world of the unseen- the encounter after death.\\n\\nThis encounter was revealed to the Prophet, who is known only to speak the truth, and because of this we believe in what has been conveyed to us from him-both the physical and abstract alike.\\n\\n# The Seen vs. the Unseen\\n\\nThe hadith concludes by emphasizing the concept of predestination. It reinforces in the mind of the believer the purpose of revelation in general: to illustrate the greatness of Allah (swt). The ‘here and now,’ the physical, is compared to the ‘future,’ the unseen, belittling the former in the greatness of the latter.\\n\\nA man will do so much good all his life and when he is near death, he changes his ways and does actions that are characteristic of the inhabitants of hell and vice versa. We can perceive an action as being either good or bad, but the intention behind the action is beyond our perception. In essence, a person may perform a seemingly good deed but if his intentions are not right, he may end up among the losers. Some scholars have taken these words literally. We know too well through our own experiences that this is the reality of human nature: people change, as they say, overnight! The story of the second caliph Umar ibn Al-Khattab (ra) is a golden example of this concept. The accounts of his early life cannot explain him being among the ten who were promised Paradise.\\n\\nAllah (swt) is not limited by time because He (swt) created the mind that is limited by time. We must know that the way we perceive our lives {years} is not comparable to the way it is in the sight of Allah (swt). He is not limited by the limits of our understanding- He is as complex as He has allowed it to be. However, out of His wisdom, He has not allowed us to wallow in this abstractness. He has given a proof for this abstract truth {Al Qadaa wal Qadar) in the example of the life of the Prophet.\\n\\n# A Few Lessons\\n\\nThis hadith introduces the concept of fear and hope. Let fear overcome you in the matters of your good deeds as by Allah’s decree, one bad deed that follows may negate them. Conversely, let hope overcome you in the matters of your bad deeds as by Allah’s decree, one good deed that follows may purify you from their harm.\\n\\nThe concept of Al Qadaa Wal Qadar does not limit other hadith or negate Quranic texts that command the believer to continue to perfect his deeds hoping for the good in the hereafter. As described, this concept should help us understand the greatness of Allah, His limitless knowledge and our limits in comparison.\\n\\nFinally, this hadith presents evidence that will help scholars in deriving fatwa on such complex issues of embryonic studies and other ethical issues such as abortion. The ultimate knowledge of all affairs is with Allah Alone, may He be glorified.\",slug:\"4-deeds-are-by-their-final-actions\"},{title:\"Be in This World As a Traveler\",hadith_count:\"40\",date:t,hadith_source:'عَنْ ابْن عُمَرَ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمَا قَالَ: أَخَذَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه و سلم بِمَنْكِبِي، وَقَالَ:\\n\\n>  \"كُنْ فِي الدُّنْيَا كَأَنَّك غَرِيبٌ أَوْ عَابِرُ سَبِيلٍ\".\\n\\n وَكَانَ ابْنُ عُمَرَ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمَا يَقُولُ:\\n\\n>  إذَا أَمْسَيْتَ فَلَا تَنْتَظِرْ الصَّبَاحَ، وَإِذَا أَصْبَحْتَ فَلَا تَنْتَظِرْ الْمَسَاءَ، وَخُذْ مِنْ صِحَّتِك لِمَرَضِك، وَمِنْ حَيَاتِك لِمَوْتِك.\\r\\n>\\n> \\\\[رَوَاهُ الْبُخَارِيُّ].',hadith_english:\"On the authority of Abdullah ibn Umar (ra), who said:\\r\\n\\nThe Messenger of Allah (saw) took me by the shoulder and said, \\n\\n> “Be in this world as though you were a stranger or a wayfarer.”\\r\\n\\nAnd Ibn Umar (ra) used to say, \\n\\n> “In the evening do not expect \\\\[to live until] the morning, and in the morning do not expect \\\\[to live until] the evening.

Jamaal Diwan's audio commentary above and English translation of Ibn Daqiq Al-Id's commentary on The Forty Hadith of Imam al-Nawawi._\\n\\nThis is one of two hadiths that encompass the entirety of Islam according to scholars. The first is “Verily actions are by intention...” which addresses the internal aspect of practicing Islam. Everything we do should be with the intention of pleasing Allah (swt) and by purifying our intentions we accomplish a great deal in our religion.\\n\\nScholars say that the acceptance of actions of Ibadah (worship) is based on the above two conditions:\\n\\n* The intention - the action should be done with sincerity, for the sake of only Allah.\\n* It should be done in accordance with the Sunnah of the Prophet (sas)\\n\\n# Good Intentions Are Not Enough\\n\\nGood intentions alone are not enough. We must also ensure that our actions are done properly in accordance with the example of the Prophet (sas) and the guidelines of Islam. Sometimes we may think it enough to be sincere, without making the effort to ensure that what we are doing is also correct. This hadith encompasses the second crucial aspect of the practice of Islam, which is ensuring that the outward performance of our actions is right.\\n\\nProphet Muhammad (sas) began his sermons with the following words, which are repeated in the opening of khutbahs everywhere, “Verily the most truthful speech is Allah’s Book and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad peace be upon him. And verily the worst affairs are those introduced into the religion without basis.”\\n\\nIbn Rajab in his commentary on the 40 Hadith of Nawawi noted, “that which has no basis or that which is not from it,” implies that every single one of our actions and deeds should be aligned with the guidelines of Islam. This does not necessarily mean that the Sunnah of the Prophet (sas) literally addressed every single action, but rather that all we do should fall within the general guidelines laid out in Islam.\\n\\nSome people think that if they are just following someone else, as long as they themselves did not invent something, then their action is acceptable. This is not true; every person is responsible for being diligent in making sure their actions are correct. Emulating and following the Prophet (sas) is a Qur'anic obligation. Allah, the Almighty says:\\n\\n_Verily, in the apostle of God you have the best example to emulate for everyone who looks forward (with hope and awe) to Allah and the Last Day, and remembers Allah unceasingly. (Surah Al-Ahzab 33 21)._\\n\\n# The Difference between Worship and Daily Life\\n\\nIt is important here to differentiate between worship (ibadaat) and daily life and interactions (mu’amalat). With regard to worship, the rule of thumb is that something is forbidden by default unless there is supporting evidence in the Quran and Sunnah. We cannot make things up; only the acts of worship explicitly laid out by the Quran and Sunnah are acceptable. On the other hand, non-worship actions (mu’amalat) are permissible unless there is textual evidence that prohibits them. The type of clothing we wear, our choices in food, and many other everyday matters are left up to individual choice so long as there is no contradiction in the sources of Islam.\\n\\n# Religious Innovation (Bid’ah)\\n\\nThere is a lot of controversy over the issue of innovation in religion, or bid’ah, and this hadith is quoted frequently in that debate. It is a complicated topic about which many people are either over- or under- zealous. While the topic cannot be addressed in a few sentences, here are a few pointers that give a balanced perspective:\\n\\n* Imam ash-Shafi’i and others asserted that there is such a thing as a bid’ah hasana, a good innovation. An example used to illustrate this concept is Taraweeh prayer. The Prophet (sas) did not explicitly order the people to gather for Taraweeh prayer, but Umar ibn al-Khattab later established it as a consistent congregational practice.\\n* The guidelines and general principles of Islam create a broad definition of what is “from it.” Once, the companions were performing prayer in congregation behind the Prophet (sas). When they rose from ruku’, after the customary saying ‘Our Lord to You is praise,’ one companion added on his own, “Good and blessed Praise in multitudes that fill the heavens and fill the earth and fill what is between them.” The Prophet turned to his companions after the prayer was finished and asked who had said those words. No one answered. The Prophet said that he only asked because more than 30 angels raced each other and competed to write down the reward of those words.\\n* Other examples supporting the above points are Uthman ibn Affan’s decision during his rule to compile the standard copy of the Quran, and the establishment of schools of fiqh (madhahib) by many scholars later on.\",video:\"https://youtube.com/embed/MIhunCoC27k\",slug:\"5-rejection-of-evil-deeds-and-innovations\"},{title:\"Protecting the Heart\",hadith_count:\"6\",date:\"2019-10-07T19:37:43.065Z\",hadith_source:'عَنْ أَبِي عَبْدِ اللَّهِ النُّعْمَانِ بْنِ بَشِيرٍ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمَا، قَالَ: سَمِعْت رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه و سلم يَقُولُ:\\n\\n> \"إنَّ الْحَلَالَ بَيِّنٌ، وَإِنَّ الْحَرَامَ بَيِّنٌ، وَبَيْنَهُمَا أُمُورٌ مُشْتَبِهَاتٌ لَا يَعْلَمُهُنَّ كَثِيرٌ مِنْ النَّاسِ، فَمَنْ اتَّقَى الشُّبُهَاتِ فَقْد اسْتَبْرَأَ لِدِينِهِ وَعِرْضِهِ، وَمَنْ وَقَعَ فِي الشُّبُهَاتِ وَقَعَ فِي الْحَرَامِ، كَالرَّاعِي يَرْعَى حَوْلَ الْحِمَى يُوشِكُ أَنْ يَرْتَعَ فِيهِ، أَلَا وَإِنَّ لِكُلِّ مَلِكٍ حِمًى، أَلَا وَإِنَّ حِمَى اللَّهِ مَحَارِمُهُ، أَلَا وَإِنَّ فِي الْجَسَدِ مُضْغَةً إذَا صَلَحَتْ صَلَحَ الْجَسَدُ كُلُّهُ، وَإذَا فَسَدَتْ فَسَدَ الْجَسَدُ كُلُّهُ، أَلَا وَهِيَ الْقَلْبُ\".\\r\\n\\n\\\\[رَوَاهُ الْبُخَارِيُّ]\\r، \\\\[وَمُسْلِمٌ]\\r.\\n\\n.',hadith_english:\"On the authority of Abu 'Abdullah al-Nu'man bin Bashir (ra) who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah(sas) say:\\n\\n> \\\"The halal is clear and the haram is clear, and between them are matters unclear that are unknown to most people.

Jamaal Diwan's audio commentary above and English translation of Ibn Daqiq Al-Id's commentary on The Forty Hadith of Imam al-Nawawi._\\n\\nThis hadith is very comprehensive. It covers so many areas of the Sharee'ah, Islamic law. Imam al-Nawawi and many scholars consider this Hadith as one of four of five ahadith around which the entire religion of Islam is understood. This Hadith indicates that all matters are one of three types: halal, haram and doubtful.\\n\\n# The Halal is Clear\\n\\nWhatever Allah has established to be permissible in a text, then it is the 'clear' Halal.\\n\\n> This day \\\\[all] good foods have been made lawful, and the food of those who were given the Scripture is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them. \\\\[al-Maa'idah 5:5]\\n\\nHalal is what we seek when dealing with our relationship with Allah (swt), when we are dealing with understanding Islam and when we are dealing with how to build and improve our community. The halal is clear. It is what is clearly allowed, and there is no doubt about it.\\n\\n# The Haram is Clear\\n\\nThe 'clear' haram is whatever is clearly established in the Islamic sources, such as the statement of Allah (swt),\\n\\n> Prohibited to you \\\\[for marriage] are your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your father's sisters... \\\\[an-Nisaa 4:23]\\n\\nThe clear haram is what is clearly prohibited and everybody knows that it is prohibited; there is no difference in opinion. Drugs, alcohol, oppression, and stealing are haram. Haram also includes the fawaahish (evil lusts and desires), that which is apparent and that which is hidden. Every matter that Allah (swt) associated with a punishment or a threat is also included amongst the 'clear' haram.\\n\\n# The Doubtful Matters\\n\\nMost people don’t understand what doubtful matters are and what their ruling is. There are two things scholars have said about doubtful matters. The first opinion is that doubtful matters are those that scholars disagree about their permissibility: music, for example. The second opinion is that doubtful matters are those that mix between halal and haram. The general rule regarding doubtful matters is whoever stays away from them has purified their deen and honor.\\n\\nThe scholars differ on whether doubtful matters are halal or haram.\\n\\n* One opinion is that all doubtful matters are haram, due the saying of the Messenger (sas) in this hadith \\\"\\\\[he] clears himself in regard to his religion and his honor.\\\" \\n* Another opinion is that all doubtful matters are halal, due the statement of the Prophet (sas) \\\"like the shepherd who pastures around a sanctuary.” This indicates that these actions are permissible, but leaving them is from piety.\\n* And a third opinion is that we make no ruling regarding the doubtful matters, and do not say that they are halal or haram, as the Prophet (sas) placed them between the clear halal and the clear haram. Hence we should refrain from passing judgment, and this, too, is from piety.\\n\\nThe Prophet (sas) follows the statement, “between the two of them are doubtful matters” by saying, “most people do not know them.” This means that some people do. It is the job of scholars to put forth their best effort in looking at all of the evidence and reaching their opinion. If they are correct, they receive two rewards and if they are wrong they are still rewarded. For those of us who are following opinions of the scholars, that is all that is required from us. But we should keep in mind that staying away from doubtful matters purifies our deen and honor.\\n\\n# Blocking of the Means (Sad al-Zarai')\\n\\nThis hadith is actually a corroborating evidence for a concept in Usul Al-Fiqh called “Sadd al-Dhara’i” (Blocking of the Means). This means that you have to block any action which might lead to haram. The Prophet (sas) gives the example of a person who has a flock, and the flock is going towards some land that is off-limits. That person keeps getting closer and closer to that land, eventually the sheep are going to stray into the prohibited property. Just as a King has a sanctuary, which the shepherds must keep their sheep away from, so too has Allah specified certain things as forbidden for his slaves. We should avoid the disliked, and sometimes even refrain from the permissible in order to avoid falling into the prohibited.\\n\\n# The Morsel of Flesh\\n\\nAs the Prophet said, we all have a morsel of flesh in our bodies. If it is good, our whole is good and if it is not, then our whole body is spoiled. This hadith outlines a whole process of strengthening and purifying our hearts on the path to Allah: being alert to the halal and haram and avoiding the doubtful. The Prophet says in another hadith,\\n\\n> A person’s iman will not be upright until their heart is upright and strong. The heart will not be upright and strong until the tongue is upright and strong.\\n\\nThe Prophet is laying out the path to purifying and strengthening the heart, which leads to the completion of one’s faith.\",video:\"https://youtube.com/embed/2CT8gbkJR4s\",slug:\"6-protecting-the-heart\"},{title:\"The Religion is Naseehah (Sincere Advice)\",hadith_count:\"7\",date:\"2019-10-07T19:40:31.592Z\",hadith_source:'عَنْ أَبِي رُقَيَّةَ تَمِيمِ بْنِ أَوْسٍ الدَّارِيِّ رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ أَنَّ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ:\\n\\n> \"الدِّينُ النَّصِيحَةُ.\" قُلْنَا: لِمَنْ؟ قَالَ: \"لِلَّهِ، وَلِكِتَابِهِ، وَلِرَسُولِهِ، وَلِأَئِمَّةِ الْمُسْلِمِينَ وَعَامَّتِهِمْ.\"\\r\\n\\n\\\\[رَوَاهُ مُسْلِمٌ]',hadith_english:'On the authority of Tamim Al-Dari (may Allah be pleased with him):\\n\\n> The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, \"The religion is naseehah (sincerity).\" We said, \"To whom?\" He (peace be upon him) said, \"To Allah, His Book, His Messenger, and to the leaders of the Muslims and their common folk.\"\\n\\n\\\\[Muslim]',commentary:\"_Written commentary compiled by volunteers utilizing Sh. Jamaal Diwan's audio commentary above and English translation of Ibn Daqiq Al-Id's commentary on The Forty Hadith of Imam al-Nawawi._\\n\\nThis Hadith focuses on al-Nasihah, advice or sincerity. The Prophet (sas) says that the entire religion is encompassed in the concept of nasihah and that the main pillar of the religion and its soundness lies in this concept of nasihah.\\n\\nNasihah is usually translated as advice, but this translation does not convey the true meaning of the word. The closer meaning of the term nasihah is sincerity. That means that the entire religion is encompassed by the concept of sincerity.\\n\\nThe Prophet (sas) stated in the hadith that nasihah should be given to five categories: to Allah, His Book, His Messenger, to the leaders of the Muslims and to the common people.\\n\\n# 1: Nasihah to Allah (swt):\\n\\nNasihah to Allah (swt) means that we should have correct belief in Allah and reject associating anything with Him. It means that we constantly try to purify our relationship with Him and be as true to this relationship as much as possible. We also do what is required of us and sustain from what is prohibited. Nasihah to Allah also means that we must know how to implement the shariah of Allah in our lives and how to journey towards Him.\\n\\n# 2. Nasihah to Allah’s Book:\\n\\nNasihah to His Book means believing that the Quran is the Speech of Allah (swt), that it was sent down as Revelation, and that there is no similarity between the Speech of Allah and the speech of mankind. To be pure and sincere in our relationship with the Quran requires that we have the utmost respect to the Quran. We call the Quran with respectful names, such as the Noble Quran and the Glorious Quran. We have to act on and respect the content of the Book, by carrying out its commands nd staying away from its prohibitions. Explaining the Quran to others, helping people understand the beauty of the Quran and defending the Quran against attacks is part of giving nasihah to Allah’s Book.\\n\\n# 3. Nasihah to Allah’s Messenger (sas):\\n\\nPart of giving Nasihah to the Prophet (sas) is knowing him, understanding his life and the struggles he went through and relating his struggles to our daily life. Loving the prophet more than anything else and loving him more than ourselves is part of giving nasihah to the Prophet. Obeying the Prophet (sas), rejecting those whom had enmity towards him, being loyal to those who gave allegiance to him, honoring him, and reviving his manners and sunnah are all important aspects of giving nasihah to the Prophet (sas).\\n\\n# 4. Nasihah to the leaders of the Muslims:\\n\\nGiving nasihah to the leaders of the Muslims involves making duaa for them that Allah guides them, protects them and makes them able to carry out their responsibilities. Another way is to correct them when they are wrong, as Abu-Bakr (raa) asked of the believers when he was entrusted with leadership, “As long as I command you to do what Allah and His Messenger commanded you to do, then you should obey me, but if don’t then you should set me straight.” Another way of giving naseeha to the leaders of the Muslims is to know them, interact with them, get involved in their efforts in a constructive way and not to sit back and criticize what they are doing without trying to help them.\\n\\n# 5. Nasihah to the Muslim people:\\n\\nGiving nasihah to the Muslims in general means giving them advice. The Prophet (sas) said, “The rights of a believer over a believer are six,” and then he mentioned that among them is \\\"if he asks you for an advice you have to give him advice.” Giving nasihah involves guiding them towards that which will correct their affairs in both this life and the next. It involves protecting them from harm, helping them in times of need, providing what is beneficial for them, encouraging them to do good and forbidding them from evil with kindness and sincerity, and showing mercy towards them.\",video:\"https://youtube.com/embed/1DTwPbNTiTY\",slug:\"7-the-religion-is-naseehah-sincere-advice\"},{title:\"The Sanctity of a Muslim\",hadith_count:\"8\",date:\"2019-10-07T19:42:56.267Z\",hadith_source:'عَنْ ابْنِ عُمَرَ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمَا، أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه و سلم قَالَ:\\n\\n> \"أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أُقَاتِلَ النَّاسَ حَتَّى يَشْهَدُوا أَنْ لَا إلَهَ إلَّا اللَّهُ وَأَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ اللَّهِ، وَيُقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ، وَيُؤْتُوا الزَّكَاةَ؛ فَإِذَا فَعَلُوا ذَلِكَ عَصَمُوا مِنِّي دِمَاءَهُمْ وَأَمْوَالَهُمْ إلَّا بِحَقِّ الْإِسْلَامِ، وَحِسَابُهُمْ عَلَى اللَّهِ تَعَالَى\".\\r\\n\\n\\\\[رَوَاهُ الْبُخَارِيُّ]\\r، \\\\[وَمُسْلِمٌ].',hadith_english:\"On the authority of Abdullah ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:\\n\\n> I have been ordered to fight against the people until they testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and until they establish the Salah and pay the Zakah.

Jamaal Diwan's audio commentary above and English translation of Ibn Daqiq Al-Id's commentary on The Forty Hadith of Imam al-Nawawi._\\n\\n# Different Narrations\\n\\nThis hadith has many different narrations. Some of them actually say that “I was commanded to fight the people” and then the narrators would add in right there “meaning the polytheist” or some would say “I was commanded to fight the people until they bear witness that there is no God but Allah, and that Muhammad is His messenger.” There is no mention of prayer and fasting, and there are various different narrations within these lines.\\n\\nOne important thing to take into account is that whenever the Prophet Muhammad says, “I was commanded” in this passive form, then that means that the demand is coming directly from Allah.\\n\\n# Who Are “The People”?\\n\\nSo, what does it mean when he says,“to fight the people”? This is the most controversial and misunderstood part of the hadith. Does “people” refer to everyone, a certain group, or is there further context to this hadith? Based on the context of the life of the Prophet (sas), and the actions of the generations after him, it’s understood that this hadith does not refer to all people, by any means. There were many people that he didn’t fight and people with whom we had peace contracts. There were also people that paid jizya. They were not Muslims, but they paid this tax to the Muslim state in order to be protected and to receive services.\\n\\nIbn Hajar Al-Asqalani (ra), in his explanation of Sahih Al Bukhari, mentions five or six different possibilities for what “the people” could mean. The main point in that discussion is that the hadith refers to a particular type of people.\\n\\nOne specific incident that occurred, related to the context of this hadith, is that a group of people decided that they would no longer pay zakah when Abu Bakr became the leader of the Muslim nation. Abu Bakr took the stance that he would fight them unless they paid zakah. Many of the other companions disagreed with him, and Abu Bakr would refer to this narration, and others would refer to the narrations that don’t have the mention of establishing prayer and paying zakah.\\n\\nUmar (ra) disagreed with him and argued with him for a while. Umar later said, “When I saw that Allah had made Abu Bakr so convinced with his opinion, then I, myself, also become convinced with his opinion.” Abu Bakr said that you couldn’t distinguish between these things. They are all fundamentals of the faith and cannot be denied, in particular establishing prayer and paying zakah because of this narration.\\n\\n# The Right of Islam\\n\\nAnother point to mention is that when the believers start to establish prayer and pay zakah, they gain protection from Allah (swt) for their lives and property, unless they commit acts that are punishable in Islam, such as murder or adultery. It is important to remember that this whole discussion revolved around the responsibilities of a Muslim state, and does not really apply to us. However, what does apply to us, directly, is the issue of whether this statement means that Muslims are commanded to fight all mankind. The answer is no, based on what was said before and specifically looking at the life of the Prophet (sas).\\n\\n# “Struggle”\\n\\nThere is an ongoing discussion about the meaning of jihad in Islam. Jihad is not holy war. It means struggle, and it is a very important concept in Islam. It can refer to the struggle of an individual against oneself, speaking the word of truth in front of a tyrant, actual physical defense, or a battle that occurs on the battlefield. It’s a central concept in Islam, but it needs to be understood correctly and in a balanced and truthful way.\",video:\"https://youtube.com/embed/snhPMmMH31M\",slug:\"8-the-sanctity-of-a-muslim\"},{title:\"Obligations are According to Ability\",hadith_count:\"9\",date:\"2019-10-07T19:45:21.449Z\",hadith_source:'عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ عَبْدِ الرَّحْمَنِ بْنِ صَخْرٍ رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ قَالَ: سَمِعْت رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه و سلم يَقُولُ:\\n\\n> \"مَا نَهَيْتُكُمْ عَنْهُ فَاجْتَنِبُوهُ، وَمَا أَمَرْتُكُمْ بِهِ فَأْتُوا مِنْهُ مَا اسْتَطَعْتُمْ، فَإِنَّمَا أَهْلَكَ الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ كَثْرَةُ مَسَائِلِهِمْ وَاخْتِلَافُهُمْ عَلَى أَنْبِيَائِهِمْ \".\\r\\n\\n\\\\[رَوَاهُ الْبُخَارِيُّ]\\r، \\\\[وَمُسْلِمٌ].',hadith_english:\"On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) say:\\n\\n> What I have forbidden for you, avoid. What I have ordered you \\\\[to do], do as much of it as you can. For verily, it was only their excessive questioning and disagreeing with their Prophets that destroyed \\\\[the nations] who were before you.\\n\\n\\\\[Al-Bukhari & Muslim]\",commentary:'_Written commentary compiled by volunteers utilizing Sh. Jamaal Diwan\\'s audio commentary above and English translation of Ibn Daqiq Al-Id\\'s commentary on The Forty Hadith of Imam al-Nawawi._\\n\\nThere is another narration for this hadith that gives a deeper understanding of its meaning:\\n\\nThe Messenger of Allah (sas) addressed us and said,\\n\\n> O people! Hajj has been made obligatory upon you, so perform the Hajj. A man asked, \"Is that every year, O Messenger of Allah?\" The Prophet (sas) remained silent while the man repeated his question three times. Then he said, \"If I had said \\'yes\\' then it would have become obligatory upon you \\\\[i.e. every year], and you would not have been able to do so. Do not ask me about that which I have left unspecified, for verily the nations before you were destroyed by their excessive questioning and argumentation with their Prophets. If I order you with something then do as much of it as you are able, and if I forbid you from something then keep away from it.\"\\n\\nIn both of these narrations, the prophet (sas) commands us to avoid what he has forbidden and to follow what he has ordered us to do according to the best of our ability.\\n\\nThe Prophet (sas) also asks us to follow his guidance without asking too many questions, and to pay attention to the types of questions we ask.\\n\\n# Stay Away from What is Prohibited\\n\\n\"What I have forbidden for you, avoid.” We have to follow this command all the time, and in all situations. This order has to be followed except under dire circumstances, such as when one is starving and there is no food available except for some meat that was not properly slaughtered. In conditions other than that of necessity, however, all Muslims have to avoid what is forbidden.\\n\\n# Obligations are According to Ability\\n\\n\"What I have ordered you to do, do as much of it as you can\" is an important principle of Islam. The Prophet (sas) is indicating that we won’t be able to do all what is required, but we have to do as much of it as we can. Based upon this principle are countless other rulings. Prayer, for example: the Prophet (sas) said, \\'Pray standing; if you are not able to; pray sitting, if you are not able to; pray (while lying) on your side.\"\\n\\nThe scholars have differed over the meaning of a command by the Prophet to perform an action - does it imply repetition? That is, if we are ordered to do something then does that automatically imply that we must do it repeatedly? Or does it mean that doing it once is sufficient unless otherwise specified? For example, we are commanded with Hajj once in a lifetime, but we are also commanded with Salah five times every day. Most of the scholars decided that a command does not automatically imply repetition, while others said that we should rule on whether it implies repetition or not without further evidence.\\n\\n# Asking Too Many Questions\\n\\nAsking too many questions can be a problem in itself, particularly if we are talking about the kinds of questions that are excessive or that can clearly lead to something that you don’t want to know an answer to. We also shouldn’t ask questions that are accompanied with a degree of arrogance or are just a waste of time.\\n\\nThe companions of the Prophet (sas) rarely asked questions. In fact, there were only thirteen questions that were answered in the Quran. The answers to their few, numbered questions are in verses such as: “They ask you about the moon cycles,” “They ask you about menstruation,” “They ask you about the bounties of war.” Anas said, “We were prohibited to ask the Prophet (sas) too many questions. So we would be very happy when an intelligent bedouin came to the Prophet and asked him questions, so we could listen.” Asking too many questions and disagreeing with the Messenger (sas) can cause our destruction. If it happened to the people before us, it can happen to us too.\\n\\n# What Takes Precedence: Doing Obligatory Actions or Staying Away from What is Prohibited\\n\\nAccording to scholars, avoiding bad deeds takes precedence over doing good deeds when the bad deed is clearly prohibited and the good deed is a recommended act. When the good deed is obligatory, doing it is greater because it involves acting upon something that Allah wants from you. It is proactive obedience, as opposed to a somewhat passive avoidance of what is forbidden (although to say leaving the haram is passive is a bit of a generalization). This is an interesting discussion and some scholars will argue different perspectives.',video:\"https://youtube.com/embed/m_fs9_ja1Hg\",slug:\"9-obligations-are-according-to-ability\"}],pagePosts:[{title:\"The Collection\",date:t,content:\"# The 40 Hadith Collection\\n\\nIn the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful\\n\\n[Imam al-Nawawi’s](/the-imam) collection of 40 Hadiths is one of the most important collections of hadiths we have today. Imam al Nawawi actually compiled a total of 42 hadiths for this collection, not 40. He was one of the greatest scholars of Islam and lived from 631 A.H. to 676 A.H, passing away at the age of 45. Allah (swt) granted him blessing and success in his work so that he could make great contributions to Islam before passing away at a relatively young age.\\n\\nImam al-Nawawi was a scholar in many different disciplines of Islamic studies. The vastness of his works in these different areas is so great that if an individual decides to study fiqh, hadith, spirituality, or Quran; one would need to pass through Imam al- Nawawi. Along with the 40 Hadiths, he authored Riyad al-Saliheen, Al-Adhkar, and commentary of Sahih Muslim and Sahih Bukhari.\\n\\nImam al-Nawawi was one of the foremost figures of the Shafi’ madhab and the largest and most substantial book he wrote in this regard is called Al Majmua’ which is about 30 volumes. It is a work of comparative fiqh because he brings all of the opinions of different madhab’s on different issues together.\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nImam al-Nawawi begins the “Forty Hadith” with an introduction. Many times we are in the habit of skipping the introduction or quickly looking through introductions. This is a mistake, especially when studying Islamic sciences. We need to move on to a point where we actually know what we know and we can present it to others. This is important in being able to carry the dawah. In his introduction, Imam al-Nawawi is telling us essentially why he wrote this book, what got him to write this book and this is important in understanding the purpose of the work.\\n\\n## Points from Imam Al-Nawawi’s Introduction\\n\\n### 1.) Reason for compilation\\n\\nImam al-Nawawi begins by mentioning a narration attributed to Prophet Muhammad (sas) as one reason for the compilation of the “Forty Hadith”. The hadith states that anyone who memorizes forty hadiths from the hadiths of the Prophet (sas), Allah will resurrect him among the scholars. Imam al-Nawawi, however, also clearly mentions that this hadith is weak.\\n\\n### Types of Hadiths:\\n\\nThis is very important because we should always know what the source of our information is, whether the hadith is reliable, not reliable, is it sahih (authentic), hasan (good) or da’if (weak) and how this relates to whether a hadith is acceptable. When it comes to using weak hadiths there is a very important and profound difference in opinions. Essentially there are three main schools of thought about weak hadiths:\\n\\n1. One school of thought says one can use weak hadiths whenever you want. This is not a very strong opinion.\\n2. Another school of thought says one can never use weak hadiths\\n3. The last opinion is that one can use weak hadiths in areas about virtuous deeds and as a reminder. This is the majority opinion and what Imam al-Nawawi refers to in his introduction.\\n\\n### Conditions to using weak hadiths this way:\\n\\n1. Weak Hadiths that are related to virtues, deeds, reminders, etc. But not related to ahkam, legal rulings or related to belief.\\n2. They cannot be extremely weak, generally it is said a hadith is da’if (weak) but there are more than 30-40 different classification of da’if with some being more weak than others\\n3. The hadith comes under a general principle/ understanding of Islam, it is not bringing anything new but just adding. ex.) We have an acceptable hadith about the importance of Surah Ikhlas and there is a weak hadith that also says something similar, in this case it can be used.\\n\\nIssues around using weak hadiths is a bit more complicated. There are different opinions and we should know as students of knowledge that these complications can arise therefore it is best to not use a weak hadith if possible, in order to avoid any argumentation.\\n\\nHowever, Imam al-Nawawi also clearly says that the hadith mentioned before about memorizing the one who memorizes forty hadiths is not the only reason he is writing this book, there are other hadith’s he quotes that are authentic about seeking and conveying knowledge.\\n\\n## 2.) The Criteria of Choosing the Hadiths for this Collection:\\n\\nImam al-Nawawi also says there are many people who have written a 40 Hadith collection based on different topics, like Zuhd (aestheticism). In this compilation however he sought to use hadith’s that were comprehensive and cover all areas of religion. They will be short so they can be memorized easily and he made sure that they would be at least acceptable if not completely authentic.\\n\\nImam al-Nawawi did succeed in collecting hadith’s per his goal. They are very comprehensive to every single area of the deen. This is why Imam Hassan al-Banna recommended that active workers in dawah should also memorize the hadiths of Imam al-Nawawi, along with reading and memorizing the Quran, because they are very comprehensive and applicable to many situations.\\n\\n### Jawami' al-Kalam\\n\\nThe reason why it is so easy to be so comprehensive with only 40 hadith is because the Prophet (sas) was blessed with \\\"jawami' al kalam\\\" (comprehensive speech). The Prophet (sas) says in a hadith,\\n\\n> I was sent with comprehensive speech.\\n\\nWhat this means is as Imam az- Zuhri, one of the great early scholars who passed away around the turn of first century Hijri said,\\n\\n> As far as what has come to us from the understanding of this comprehensive speech the Prophet (sas) was given, is that Allah gave him the ability to combine many types of ideas that would formally be written in entire books, but the Prophet (sas) could portray in only a couple of sentences.\\n\\nThis is an important concept because sometimes we do not give the hadiths of the Prophet (sas) the kind of respect it deserves in understanding how great his (sas) statements were. The Prophet (sas) also said,\\n\\n> Verily I was given this comprehensive speech, and language was made concise to me with a perfect concision.\\n\\nHe (sas) was granted the ability to say simple things that have a myriad of meanings, which is why scholars early on began to compile different sets of hadiths in small amounts to benefit from this quality of the Prophet (sas).\\n\\nIbn Salah, one of the first scholars to compile these types of books, has one of the most famous books in hadith sciences called Al-Mukadimah (The Introduction.) And pretty much all the later books that come out in hadith sciences go back to his book. He first started having sittings/gatherings where he would explain hadiths and this is where the idea of explaining these comprehensive hadiths began. He reached up to 26 hadiths with their explanation and then Imam al-Nawawi came and picked up his work. Imam al- Nawawi used the 26 that was explained by Ibn Salah and then added until he finished compiling the 42 hadiths which are today famously known as “Arba’een al-Nawawi,” or “Imam Nawawi’s Forty Hadith.”\",slug:\"the-collection\"},{title:\"The Imam\",date:a,content:\"# Who was Imam an-Nawawi?\\n\\nAbu Zakariyya Muḥyi al-Dīn Yaḥya Ibn Sharaf al-Nawawi was born at Nawā, a place near Damascus, in the suburb of the city of Howran, in 631 AH (1234 CE), and died forty-four years later in 676 AH (1278 CE). From a young age he showed signs of great intelligence, so his father resolved to arrange for his education. He studied in Damascus from the age of 18 and after making the pilgrimage in 1253 he settled there as a private scholar.\\n\\n## His Studies\\n\\nAt a young age, Imam Nawawi learnt to read the Noble Qur’an and by that time he nearly had attained puberty. Nawā, at the time, had no academic or scholarly atmosphere and there were religious academies or institutions where one could earn excellence in religious learning, so his father took him to Damascus, which was considered the center of learning and scholarship, and the students from across the Ummah gathered there for Islamic learning. During that period, there were more than three hundred institutes, colleges, and universities in Damascus.\\n\\nDuring his stay in Damascus, he studied from more than twenty renowned teachers. These teachers were regarded as masters of authority in their fields of specialty and disciplines they taught. Imam Nawawi studied Hadith, Islamic Jurisprudence, its principles, syntax and etymology from some of the greatest scholars of his time.\\n\\n## His Academic Interests\\n\\nImam Nawawi had an endless thirst for knowledge, which can be deduced from his daily practice of studies. He used to read twelve lessons daily and write explanations and commentaries of every lesson, all the while making important additions. Whatever book he read, he put down the marginal notes and explanations on that book. His intelligence, hard work, love, devotion, and absorption in his studies amazed his teachers and they became fond of him and began to praise and admire him.\\n\\nOther than his reading and writing, he spent his time contemplating upon the complex issues of his time and in finding their solutions. Allah had conferred upon him the gift of a quick and strong memory along with depth of thought. Imam Nawawi made full benefit of his God-given qualities and earned the highest degree of honor among his peers and future generations.\\n\\n## His Character\\n\\nThe scholars, elite of his society, and the public greatly respected Imam Nawawi on account of his piety, learning, and excellent character. He dressed and ate simply and humbly. Devout scholars do not care about attaining worldly possessions, they give preference to religious and academic pursuits, and the dissemination and propagation of faith. They experience more heavenly delight and joy in such activities than those who seek satisfaction in luxurious life styles. He was God-fearing who had high ambitions and aims in the dissemination and propagation of faith.\\n\\n## His Works and Death\\n\\nImam Nawawi had a very short life (44 years) but even during this short period, he wrote a large number of books on various subjects. Nearly every work is a masterpiece and a treasure of knowledge. Hundreds of thousands of people have benefited from these works.\\n\\nSome of the prestigious works of Imam Nawawi, apart from the compilation of the “40 Hadith” (al-Arbaʿīn) include:\\n\\n*   Riyāḍ al-Ṣāliḥīn\\n*   Commentary on Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī\\n*   Commentary on Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim (Al-Minhāj fi Sharḥ Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim)\\n*   Sharḥ Sunan Abī Dāwūd\\n*   Mukhtaṣar Al-Tirmidhī\\n*   Kitāb al-Rawḍah\\n*   Kitāb al-Adhkār\\n*   Al-Taqrīb fī ʿIlm al-Ḥadīth wa al-Irshād fīhi\\n*   Al-Tibyān\\n*   Bustān al-ʿĀrifīn\\n\\nAfter spending 28 years in scholarly pursuits away from home, Imam Nawawi returned to his hometown. Soon after his arrival in Nawā, he fell ill and died. His works are of everlasting value.
